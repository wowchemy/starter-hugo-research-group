abstract = { Abstract. This paper introduces a novel meshfree methodology based on radial basis function–finite difference (RBF-FD) approximations for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces of codimension 1 embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). The method is built upon the principles of the closest point method, without the use of a grid or a closest point mapping. We show that the combination of local embedded stencils with these principles can be employed to approximate surface derivatives using polyharmonic spline kernels and polynomials (PHS + Poly) RBF-FD. Specifically, we show that it is enough to consider a constant extension along the normal direction only at a single node to overcome the rank deficiency of the polynomial basis. An extensive parameter analysis is presented to test the dependence of the approach. We demonstrate high-order convergence rates on problems involving surface advection and surface diffusion, and solve Turing pattern formations on surfaces defined either implicitly or by point clouds. Moreover, a simple coupling approach with a particle tracking method demonstrates the potential of the proposed method in solving PDEs on evolving surfaces in the normal direction. Our numerical results confirm the stability, flexibility, and high-order algebraic convergence of the approach.}

abstract={Neocaridina davidi, a small freshwater shrimp native to Asia, specifically China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, possesses remarkable resistance to poor water quality and offers various advantages over other invertebrate species to examine crucial issues in neuroscience and other related areas. These advantages include robustness, ease of maintenance, and transparency, making them useful for in vivo studies with optical imaging techniques. Despite its suitability for research purposes, particularly in the fields of imaging and fluorescent techniques, the lack of attention given to this species has resulted in the absence of a robust and replicable sedation protocol for immobilization and safe manipulation. Consequently, researchers face challenges in performing experimental procedures while minimizing harm to this specimen. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a simple sedation protocol specifically designed for Neocaridina davidi, assessing its effectiveness using light microscopy and image processing. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={A methodology is presented for the numerical solution of nonlinear elliptic systems in unbounded domains, consisting of three elements. First, the problem is posed on a finite domain by means of a proper nonlinear change of variables. The compressed domain is then discretised, regardless of its final shape, via the radial basis function partition of unity method. Finally, the system of nonlinear algebraic collocation equations is solved with the trust-region algorithm, taking advantage of analytically derived Jacobians. We validate the methodology on a benchmark of computational fluid mechanics: the steady viscous flow past a circular cylinder. The resulting flow characteristics compare very well with the literature. Then, we stress-test the methodology on less smooth obstacles—rounded and sharp square cylinders. As expected, in the latter scenario the solution is polluted by spurious oscillations, owing to the presence of boundary singularities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={We present a stochastic method for efficiently computing the solution of time-fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) that model anomalous diffusion problems of the subdiffusive type. After discretizing the fPDE in space, the ensuing system of fractional linear equations is solved resorting to a Monte Carlo evaluation of the corresponding Mittag-Leffler matrix function. This is accomplished through the approximation of the expected value of a suitable multiplicative functional of a stochastic process, which consists of a Markov chain whose sojourn times in every state are Mittag-Leffler distributed. The resulting algorithm is able to calculate the solution at conveniently chosen points in the domain with high efficiency. In addition, we present how to generalize this algorithm in order to compute the complete solution. For several large-scale numerical problems, our method showed remarkable performance in both shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, achieving nearly perfect scalability up to 16,384 CPU cores. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Probabilistic domain decomposition (PDD) is an alternative paradigm for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) in parallel with excellent scalability properties, thanks to its reliance on stochastic representations of the BVP. However, there are cases when the latter is less numerically convenient, or unknown. Semilinear elliptic BVPs and the Helmholtz equation are prominent examples of either class. In this paper, we overcome this issue by designing suitable iterative schemes for either problem. These schemes not only retain the desirable properties of PDD but also are optimally suited for pathwise variance reduction, resulting in a systematic, nearly cost-free reduction of the statistical error through the iterations. Numerical tests carried out on the supercomputer Marconi100 are presented. © 2024 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We propose a method for imaging in scattering media when large and diverse datasets are available. It has two steps. Using a dictionary learning algorithm the first step estimates the true Green’s function vectors as columns in an unordered sensing matrix. The array data comes from many sparse sets of sources whose location and strength are not known to us. In the second step, the columns of the estimated sensing matrix are ordered for imaging using the multidimensional scaling algorithm with connectivity information derived from cross-correlations of its columns, as in time reversal. For these two steps to work together, we need data from large arrays of receivers so the columns of the sensing matrix are incoherent for the first step, as well as from sub-arrays so that they are coherent enough to obtain connectivity needed in the second step. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed method is able to provide images in complex media whose resolution is that of a homogeneous medium. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

abstract={Within the framework of Game Theory, there are games where rewards depend on the relative rank between contenders rather than their absolute performance. We refer to these situations as contests. By relying on the formalism of Tullock success functions, we propose a model where two contenders fight in a contest on two fronts with different technology levels associated: a front with large resource demand and another with lower resource requirements. The parameter of the success function in each front determines the resource demand level. Furthermore, the redistribution or not of resources after a tie defines two different games. We solve the model analytically through the best-response map dynamics, finding a critical threshold for the ratio of the resources between contenders that determines the Nash Equilibrium basin and, consequently, the peace and fighting regimes. We also perform numerical simulations that corroborate and extend these findings. We hope this study will be of interest to areas as diverse as economic conflicts and geopolitics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In a recent paper [7], a hybrid supercomputing algorithm for elliptic equations has been proposed. The idea is that the interfacial nodal solutions solve a linear system, whose coefficients are expectations of functionals of stochastic differential equations confined within patches of about subdomain size. Compared to standard substructuring techniques, such as the Schur complement method for the skeleton, the hybrid approach produces an explicit and sparse shrunken matrix—hence suitable for substructuring again. The ultimate goal is to push strong scalability beyond the state of the art by leveraging the potential for parallelisation of stochastic calculus. Here, we present a major revamping of that framework, based on the insight of embedding the domain in a cover of overlapping circles (in two dimensions). This allows for efficient Fourier interpolation along the interfaces (now circumferences) and—crucially—for the evaluation of most of the interfacial system entries as the solution of small boundary value problems on a circle. This is both extremely efficient (as they can be solved in parallel and by the pseudospectral method) and free of Monte Carlo error. Stochastic numerics are only needed on the relatively few circles intersecting the domain boundary. In sum, the new formulation is significantly faster, simpler, and more accurate while retaining all of the advantageous properties of PDDSparse. Numerical experiments are included for the purpose of illustration. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={State of the art domain decomposition algorithms for large-scale boundary value problems (with M≫1 degrees of freedom) suffer from bounded strong scalability because they involve the synchronisation and communication of workers inherent to iterative linear algebra. Here, we introduce PDDSparse, a different approach to scientific supercomputing which relies on a “Feynman-Kac formula for domain decomposition”. Concretely, the interfacial values (only) are determined by a stochastic, highly sparse linear system G(ω)u→=b→(ω) of size O(M), whose coefficients are constructed with Monte Carlo simulations—hence embarrassingly in parallel. In addition to a wider scope for strong scalability in the deep supercomputing regime, PDDSparse has built-in fault tolerance and is ideally suited for GPUs. A proof of concept example with up to 1536 cores is discussed in detail. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The boundary data consists of a mix of displacement and traction conditions. If these are imposed as they are, and the conditions are not compatible, this leads to reduced smoothness of the solution. Therefore, the boundary data is first smoothed using the least-squares radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) framework. Then the boundary conditions are reformulated as a Robin boundary condition with smooth coefficients. The same framework is also used to approximate the boundary curve of the diaphragm cross section based on data obtained from a slice of a computed tomography (CT) scan. To solve the PDE we employ the unfitted least-squares RBF-FD method. This makes it easier to handle the geometry of the diaphragm, which is thin and non-convex. We show numerically that our solution converges with high-order towards a finite element solution evaluated on a fine grid. Through this simplified numerical model we also gain an insight into the challenges associated with the diaphragm geometry and the boundary conditions before approaching a more complex three-dimensional model. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={The paper describes a new RBF-FD based technique to compute quadrature weights on the sphere. In the proposed method, the sphere is divided into rectangles in the latitude-azimuth coordinate system, and the function is integrated over each rectangle using RBF interpolation. The method is easy to implement and its accuracy is comparable to that based on SPH expansions. One advantage of the proposed method is its ability to handle non-uniform node distributions. On this respect, we propose a new algorithm to cluster nodes in regions of steep changes in the function. It is a repulsion-based algorithm with a non-uniform distribution of electrical charges. We show that, using node clustering, the accuracy of the method can be significantly improved. © 2022 M. Kindelan et al.},

abstract={Methods based on Monte Carlo for solving linear systems have some interesting properties which make them, in many instances, preferable to classic methods. Namely, these statistical methods allow the computation of individual entries of the output, hence being able to handle problems where the size of the resulting matrix would be too large. In this paper, we propose a distributed linear algebra solver based on Monte Carlo. The proposed method is based on an algorithm that uses random walks over the system's matrix to calculate powers of this matrix, which can then be used to compute a given matrix function. Distributing the matrix over several nodes enables the handling of even larger problem instances, however it entails a communication penalty as walks may need to jump between computational nodes. We have studied different buffering strategies and provide a solution that minimizes this overhead and maximizes performance. We used our method to compute metrics of complex networks, such as node centrality and resolvent Estrada index. We present results that demonstrate the excellent scalability of our distributed implementation on very large networks, effectively providing a solution to previously unreachable problem instances. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We present an algorithm for coherent diffractive imaging with phaseless measurements. It treats the forward model as a combination of coherent and incoherent waves. The algorithm reconstructs absorption and phase contrast that quantifies the attenuation and the refraction of the waves propagating through an object. It requires coherent or partially coherent illuminations, and several detectors to record the intensity of the distorted wave that passes through the object under inspection. The diversity of illuminations, obtained by putting masks between the source and the object, provides enough information for imaging. The computational cost of our algorithm is linear in the number of pixels of the image. Therefore, it is efficient for high-resolution imaging. Our algorithm guarantees exact recovery if the image is sparse for a given basis. Numerical experiments in the setting of phaseless diffraction imaging of sparse objects validate the efficiency and the precision of the suggested algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We develop and analyze a quantitative signal subspace imaging method for single-frequency array imaging. This method is an extension to multiple signal classification which uses (i) the noise subspace to determine the location and support of targets, and (ii) the signal subspace to recover quantitative information about the targets. For point targets, we are able to recover the complex reflectivity and for an extended target under the Born approximation, we are able to recover a scalar quantity that is related to the product of the volume and relative dielectric permittivity of the target. Our resolution analysis for a point target demonstrates this method is capable of achieving exact recovery of the complex reflectivity at subwavelength resolution. Additionally, this resolution analysis shows that noise in the data effectively acts as a regularization to the imaging functional resulting in a method that is surprisingly more robust and effective with noise than without noise. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={New micro-devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles or micro-robots, have increased the demand of a new generation of small-scale combustion power system that go beyond the energy-density limitations of batteries or fuel cells. The characteristics short residence times and intense heat losses reduce the efficiency of combustion-based devices, a key factor that requires of an acute modelling effort to understand the competing physicochemical phenomena that hamper their efficient operation. With this objective in mind, this paper is devoted to the development of a high-order meshfree method to model combustion inside complex geometries using radial basis functions-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) based on polyharmonic splines (PHS) augmented with multivariate polynomials (PHS+poly). In our model, the combustion chamber of a micro-rotary engine is simulated by a system of unsteady reaction-diffusion equations coupled with a steady flow passing a bidimensional stenotic channel of great slenderness. The conversion efficiency is characterized by identifying the different combustion regimes that emerged as a function of the ignition point. We show that PHS+poly based RBF-FD is able to achieve high-order algebraic convergence on scattered node distributions, enabling for node refinement in key regions of the fluid domain. This feature makes it specially well adapted to integrate problems in irregular geometries with front-like solutions, such as reactive fronts or shock waves. Several numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We introduce a new local meshfree method for the approximation of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a smooth surface in R3. It is a direct method that uses radial basis functions augmented with multivariate polynomials. A key element of this method is that it does not need an explicit expression of the surface, which can be simply defined by a set of scattered nodes. Likewise, it does not require expressions for the surface normal vectors or for the curvature of the surface, which are approximated using explicit formulas derived in the paper. An additional advantage is that it is a local method and, hence, the matrix that approximates the Laplace–Beltrami operator is sparse, which translates into good scalability properties. The convergence, accuracy and other computational characteristics of the proposed method are studied numerically. Its performance is shown by solving two reaction–diffusion partial differential equations on surfaces; the Turing model for pattern formation, and the Schaeffer’s model for electrical cardiac tissue behavior. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We present a holographic imaging approach for the case in which a single source-detector pair is used to scan a sample. The source-detector pair collects intensity-only data at different frequencies and positions. By using an appropriate illumination strategy, we recover field cross correlations over different frequencies for each scan location. The problem is that these field cross correlations are asynchronized, so they have to be aligned first in order to image coherently. This is the main result of the paper: a simple algorithm to synchronize field cross correlations at different locations. Thus, one can recover full field data up to a global phase that is common to all scan locations. The recovered data are, then, coherent over space and frequency so they can be used to form high-resolution three-dimensional images. Imaging with intensity-only data is therefore as good as coherent imaging with full data. In addition, we use an `1-norm minimization algorithm that promotes the low dimensional structure of the images, allowing for deep high-resolution imaging. © 2021 OSA - The Optical Society.

Solving for X creates a bottleneck as the number of unknowns grows now quadratically in K. To solve this problem efficiently a dimension reduction approach is proposed in which the contribution of the off-diagonal terms \rho_{i} \rho_{j}^{\ast} for \mathbf{i} \neq \mathbf{j} to the data is treated as noise and is absorbed using the Noise Collector [1].

abstract={We review the Probabilistic Domain Decomposition (PDD) method for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems. This Domain Decomposition (DD) method is based on a suitable probabilistic representation of the solution given in the form of an expectation which, in turns, involves the solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). While the structure of the SDE depends only upon the corresponding PDE, the expectation also depends upon the boundary data of the problem. The method consists of three stages: (i) only few values of the sought solution are solved by Monte Carlo or Quasi-Monte Carlo at some interfaces; (ii) a continuous approximation of the solution over these interfaces is obtained via interpolation; and (iii) prescribing the previous (partial) solutions as additional Dirichlet boundary conditions, a fully decoupled set of sub-problems is finally solved in parallel. For linear parabolic problems, this is based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula, while for semilinear parabolic equations requires a suitable generalization based on branching diffusion processes. In case of semilinear transport equations and the Vlasov-Poisson system, a generalization of the probabilistic representation was also obtained in terms of the Method of Characteristics (characteristic curves). Finally, we present the latest progress towards the extension of the PDD method for nonlocal fractional operators. The algorithm notably improves the scalability of classical algorithms and is suited to massively parallel implementation, enjoying arbitrary scalability and fault tolerance properties. Numerical examples conducted in 1D and 2D, including some for the KPP equation and Plasma Physics, are given. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={We present a novel approach for recovering a sparse signal from quadratic measurements corresponding to a rank-one tensorization of the data vector. Such quadratic measurements, referred to as interferometric or cross-correlated data, naturally arise in many fields such as remote sensing, spectroscopy, holography and seismology. Compared to the sparse signal recovery problem that uses linear measurements, the unknown in this case is a matrix formed by the cross correlations of the sought signal. This creates a bottleneck for the inversion since the number of unknowns grows quadratically with the dimension of the signal. The main idea of the proposed approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by recovering only the diagonal of the unknown matrix, whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the signal, and use an efficient Noise Collector to absorb the cross-correlated data that come from the off-diagonal elements of this matrix. These elements do not carry extra information about the support of the signal, but significantly contribute to these data. With this strategy, we recover the unknown matrix by solving a convex linear problem whose cost is similar to the one that uses linear measurements. Our theory shows that the proposed approach provides exact support recovery when the data is not too noisy, and that there are no false positives for any level of noise. It also demonstrates that the level of sparsity that can be recovered scales almost linearly with the number of data. The numerical experiments presented in the paper corroborate these findings. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

The algorithm is based on a multilevel Monte Carlo method, and the vector solution is computed probabilistically generating suitable random paths which evolve through the indices of the matrix according to a suitable probability law. The computational complexity is proved in this paper to be significantly better than the classical Monte Carlo method, which allows the computation of much more accurate solutions. Furthermore, the positive features of the algorithm in terms of parallelism were exploited in practice to develop a highly scalable implementation capable of solving some test problems very efficiently using high performance supercomputers equipped with a large number of cores. For the specific case of shared memory architectures the performance of the algorithm was compared with the results obtained using an available Krylov-based algorithm, outperforming the latter in all benchmarks analyzed so far. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The ability to detect sparse signals from noisy, high-dimensional data is a top priority in modern science and engineering. It is well known that a sparse solution of the linear system Aρ = b0 can be found efficiently with an l1-norm minimization approach if the data are noiseless. However, detection of the signal from data corrupted by noise is still a challenging problem as the solution depends, in general, on a regularization parameter with optimal value that is not easy to choose. We propose an efficient approach that does not require any parameter estimation. We introduce a no-phantom τ and the Noise Collector matrix C and solve an augmented system Aρ + Cn = b0 + e, where e is the noise. We show that the l1-norm minimal solution of this system has zero false discovery rate for any level of noise, with probability that tends to one as the dimension of b0 increases to infinity. We obtain exact support recovery if the noise is not too large and develop a fast Noise Collector algorithm, which makes the computational cost of solving the augmented system comparable with that of the original one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in applications to passive array imaging. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider imaging problems that can be cast in the form of an underdetermined linear system of equations. When a single measurement vector is available, a sparsity promoting ℓ1-minimization-based algorithm may be used to solve the imaging problem efficiently. A suitable algorithm in the case of multiple measurement vectors would be the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) which is a subspace projection method. We provide in this work a theoretical framework in an abstract linear algebra setting that allows us to examine under what conditions the ℓ1-minimization problem and the MUSIC method admit an exact solution. We also examine the performance of these two approaches when the data are noisy. Several imaging configurations that fall under the assumptions of the theory are discussed such as active imaging with single-or multiple-frequency data. We also show that the phase-retrieval problem can be re-cast under the same linear system formalism using the polarization identity and relying on diversity of illuminations. The relevance of our theoretical analysis in imaging is illustrated with numerical simulations and robustness to noise is examined by allowing the background medium to be weakly inhomogeneous. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.},

The method is based on the numerical evaluation of the Laplace transform of the matrix exponential, which is computed efficiently using a multilevel Monte Carlo method. Essentially, it requires generating suitable random paths which evolve through the indices of the matrix according to the probability law of a continuous-time Markov chain governed by the associated Laplacian matrix. The convergence of the proposed multilevel method has been discussed, and several numerical examples were run to test the performance of the algorithm. These examples concern the computation of some metrics of interest in the analysis of complex networks, and the numerical solution of a boundary-value problem for an elliptic partial differential equation. In addition, the algorithm was conveniently parallelized, and the scalability analyzed and compared with the results of other existing Monte Carlo method for solving linear algebra systems. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This work designs a methodology to quantify the uncertainty of a volatility parameter in a stochastic control problem arising in energy management. The difficulty lies in the non-linearity of the underlying scalar Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We proceed by decomposing the unknown solution on a Hermite polynomial basis (of the unknown volatility), whose different coefficients are solutions to a system of second order parabolic non-linear PDEs. Numerical tests show that computing the first basis elements may be enough to get an accurate approximation with respect to the uncertain volatility parameter. We provide an example of the methodology in the context of a swing contract (energy contract with flexibility in purchasing energy power), this allows us to introduce the concept of Uncertainty Value Adjustment (UVA), whose aim is to value the risk of misspecification of the volatility model. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We consider the problem of imaging sparse scenes from a few noisy data using an ℓ1-minimization approach. This problem can be cast as a linear system of the form Ap = b, where A is an N × K measurement matrix. We assume that the dimension of the unknown sparse vector p ϵ ℂk is much larger than the dimension of the data vector b ϵ ℂN, i.e. K Gt; N. We provide a theoretical framework that allows us to examine under what conditions the ℓ1-minimization problem admits a solution that is close to the exact one in the presence of noise. Our analysis shows that ℓ1-minimization is not robust for imaging with noisy data when high resolution is required. To improve the performance of ℓ1-minimization we propose to solve instead the augmented linear system [A|C]p = b, where the N × σ matrix C is a noise collector. It is constructed so as its column vectors provide a frame on which the noise of the data, a vector of dimension N, can be well approximated. Theoretically, the dimension σ of the noise collector should be eN which would make its use not practical. However, our numerical results illustrate that robust results in the presence of noise can be obtained with a large enough number of columns σ ≺∼ 10K. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The combination of polyharmonic splines (PHS) with high degree polynomials (PHS+poly) has recently opened new opportunities for radial basis function generated finite difference approximations. The PHS+poly formulation, which relies on a polynomial least squares fitting to enforce the local polynomial reproduction property, resembles somehow the so-called moving least squares (MLS) method. Although these two meshfree approaches are increasingly used nowadays, no direct comparison has been done yet. The present study aims to fill this gap, focusing on scattered data interpolation and derivative approximation. We first review the MLS approach and show that under some mild assumptions PHS+poly can be formulated analogously. Based on heuristic perspectives and numerical demonstrations, we then compare their performances in 1-D and 2-D. One key result is that, as previously found for PHS+poly, MLS can also overcome the edge oscillations (Runge’s phenomenon) by simply increasing the stencil size for a fixed polynomial degree. This is, however, controlled by a weighted least squares fitting which fails for high polynomial degrees. Overall, PHS+poly is found to perform superior in terms of accuracy and robustness. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) approximations generalize grid-based regular finite differences to scattered node sets. These become particularly effective when they are based on polyharmonic splines (PHS) augmented with multi-variate polynomials (PHS+poly). One key feature is that high orders of accuracy can be achieved without having to choose an optimal shape parameter and without having to deal with issues related to numerical ill-conditioning. The strengths of this approach were previously shown to be especially striking for approximations near domain boundaries, where the stencils become highly one-sided. Due to the polynomial Runge phenomenon, regular FD approximations of high accuracy will in such cases have very large weights well into the domain. The inclusion of PHS-type RBFs in the process of generating weights makes it possible to avoid this adverse effect. With that as motivation, this study aims at gaining a better understanding of the behavior of PHS+poly generated RBF-FD approximations near boundaries, illustrating it in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

We discuss several active array imaging configurations where this factorization is exact, as well as other configurations where the factorization only holds approximately and, hence, the results provided by MUSIC deteriorate. We give special attention to the most general setting where an active array with an arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers uses signals of multiple frequencies to image the targets. This setting provides all the possible diversity of information that can be obtained from the illuminations. We give a theorem that shows that MUSIC is robust with respect to additive noise provided that the targets are well separated. The theorem also shows the relevance of using appropriate sets of controlled parameters, such as excitations, to form the images with MUSIC robustly.

abstract={In this paper we present a method that uses radial basis functions to approximate the Laplace–Beltrami operator that allows to solve numerically diffusion (and reaction–diffusion) equations on smooth, closed surfaces embedded in R3. The novelty of the method is in a closed-form formula for the Laplace–Beltrami operator derived in the paper, which involve the normal vector and the curvature at a set of points on the surface of interest. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not rely on the explicit knowledge of the surface, which can be simply defined by a set of scattered nodes. In that case, the surface is represented by a level set function from which we can compute the needed normal vectors and the curvature. The formula for the Laplace–Beltrami operator is exact for radial basis functions and it also depends on the first and second derivatives of these functions at the scattered nodes that define the surface.

abstract={We present a method to obtain quantitatively accurate images of small obstacles or inhomogeneities situated near the surface of a strongly scattering medium. The method uses time-resolved measurements of backscattered light to form the images. Using the asymptotic solution of the radiative transfer equation for this problem, we determine that the key information content in measurements is modeled by a diffusion approximation that is valid for small sourcedetector distances, and shallow penetration depths. We simplify this model further by linearizing the effect of the inhomogeneities about the known background optical properties using the Born approximation. The resulting model is used in a two-stage imaging algorithm. First, the spatial location of the inhomogeneities are determined using a modification of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. Using those results, we then determine the quantitative values of the inhomogeneities through a least-squares approximation. We find that this two-stage method is most effective for reconstructing a sequence of one-dimensional images along the penetration depth corresponding to null source-detector separations rather than simultaneously using measurements over several source-detector distances. This method is limited to penetration depths and distances between boundary measurements on the order of the scattering mean-free path. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.},

abstract={We present a method to obtain optimal RBF-FD formulas which maximize their frequency range of validity. The optimization is based on the idea of keeping an error of interest (dispersion, phase or group velocity errors) below a given threshold for a wavenumber interval as large as possible. To find the weights of these optimal finite difference formulas we solve an optimization problem. In a previous work we developed a method to optimize the frequency range of validity for finite difference weights. That method required to solve a system of nonlinear equations with as many unknowns as half of the number of weights, which is a very hard task when the number of nodes gets large. The current method requires solving an optimization problem with only one parameter, which makes finding a global minimum easier, and thus can be used for bigger stencils. We also study which of the standard RBF are more appropriate for this problem and introduce a new RBF that depends on two parameters. This new RBF improves the resulting frequency response of the RBF-FD methods while keeping the cost of the optimization problem low. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we analyze the use of simple models for solving the inverse problem in electrocardiography (IPE), which aims at recovering the heart condition from a set of remote voltages measurements. Specifically, we consider here the problem of estimating the shape, size and location of cardiac ischemic regions. The forward problem to generate the data (voltage measurements) is formulated by using the Luo-Rudy model, which provides a detailed description of the electrical behavior of cardiac cells. As for the inversion process, we use the two-current phenomenological model. The inversion procedure also incorporates a semi-automatic stage to characterize the conduction properties of the cardiac tissue. The ischemic regions are modeled by using standard level set techniques. Numerical results show that the algorithm is capable of estimating the position, size and shape of cardiac ischemic regions from noisy voltage measurements, for both 2D and 3D geometries. Our inverse procedure is benchmarked against zero-order Tikhonov regularization. This work is a proof of principle demonstrating the possibility of using simple models in the IPE towards realistic situations. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={The numerical solution of large-scale PDEs, such as those occurring in data-driven applications, unavoidably require powerful parallel computers and tailored parallel algorithms to make the best possible use of them. In fact, considerations about the parallelization and scalability of realistic problems are often critical enough to warrant acknowledgement in the modelling phase. The purpose of this paper is to spread awareness of the Probabilistic Domain Decomposition (PDD) method, a fresh approach to the parallelization of PDEs with excellent scalability properties. The idea exploits the stochastic representation of the PDE and its approximation via Monte Carlo in combination with deterministic high-performance PDE solvers. We describe the ingredients of PDD and its applicability in the scope of data science. In particular, we highlight recent advances in stochastic representations for non-linear PDEs using branching diffusions, which have significantly broadened the scope of PDD. We envision this work as a dictionary giving large-scale PDE practitioners references on the very latest algorithms and techniques of a non-standard, yet highly parallelizable, methodology at the interface of deterministic and probabilistic numerical methods. We close this work with an invitation to the fully non-linear case and open research questions. © Cambridge University Press 2017.},

abstract={RBF-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) have in the last decade emerged as a very powerful and flexible numerical approach for solving a wide range of PDEs. We find in the present study that combining polyharmonic splines (PHS) with multivariate polynomials offers an outstanding combination of simplicity, accuracy, and geometric flexibility when solving elliptic equations in irregular (or regular) regions. In particular, the drawbacks on accuracy and stability due to Runge's phenomenon are overcome once the RBF stencils exceed a certain size due to an underlying minimization property. Test problems include the classical 2-D driven cavity, and also a 3-D global electric circuit problem with the earth's irregular topography as its bottom boundary. The results we find are fully consistent with previous results for data interpolation. © 2016},

abstract={It is a widely established fact that standard semi-Lagrangian advection schemes are highly efficient numerical techniques for simulating the transport of atmospheric tracers. However, as they are not formally mass conserving, it is essential to use some method for restoring mass conservation in long time range forecasts. A common approach is to use global mass fixers. This is the case of the semi-Lagrangian advection scheme in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model used by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Mass fixers are algorithms with substantial differences in complexity and sophistication but in general of low computational cost. This paper shows the positive impact mass fixers have on the inter-hemispheric gradient of total atmospheric column-averaged CO2 and CH4, a crucial feature of their spatial distribution. Two algorithms are compared: the simple "proportional" and the more complex Bermejo-Conde schemes. The former is widely used by several Earth system climate models as well the CAMS global forecasts and analysis of atmospheric composition, while the latter has been recently implemented in IFS. Comparisons against total column observations demonstrate that the proportional mass fixer is shown to be suitable for the low-resolution simulations, but for the high-resolution simulations the Bermejo-Conde scheme clearly gives better results. These results have potential repercussions for climate Earth system models using proportional mass fixers as their resolution increases. It also emphasises the importance of benchmarking the tracer mass fixers with the inter-hemispheric gradient of long-lived greenhouse gases using observations. © Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={This work analyzes different current source and conductivity parameterizations and their influence on the diurnal variation of the global electric circuit (GEC). The diurnal variations of the current source parameterizations obtained using electric field and conductivity measurements from plane overflights combined with global Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite data give generally good agreement with measured diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok, Antarctica, where reference experimental measurements are performed. An approach employing 85 GHz passive microwave observations to infer currents within the GEC is compared and shows the best agreement in amplitude and phase with experimental measurements. To study the conductivity influence, GEC models solving the continuity equation in 3-D are used to calculate atmospheric resistance using yearly averaged conductivity obtained from the global circulation model Community Earth System Model (CESM). Then, using current source parameterization combining mean currents and global counts of electrified clouds, if the exponential conductivity is substituted by the conductivity from CESM, the peak to peak diurnal variation of the ionospheric potential of the GEC decreases from 24% to 20%. The main reason for the change is the presence of clouds while effects of222 Rn ionization, aerosols, and topography are less pronounced. The simulated peak to peak diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok is increased from 15% to 18% from the diurnal variation of the global current in the GEC if conductivity from CESM is used. © 2017.

There is no need for phase reconstruction in this approach. Using interferometric imaging methods we show that in homogeneous media there is no loss of resolution when imaging with intensities only.

In this study, we find that (i) polyharmonic splines (PHS) in conjunction with supplementary polynomials provide a very simple way to defeat stagnation (also known as saturation) error and (ii) give particularly good accuracy for the tasks of interpolation and derivative approximations without the hassle of determining a shape parameter. In follow-up studies, we will focus on how to best use these hybrid RBF polynomial bases for FD approximations in the contexts of solving elliptic and hyperbolic type PDEs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We present a comprehensive study of the resolution and stability properties of sparse promoting optimization theories applied to narrow band array imaging of localized scatterers. We consider homogeneous and heterogeneous media, and multiple and single scattering situations. When the media is homogeneous with strong multiple scattering between scatterers, we give a non-iterative formulation to find the locations and reflectivities of the scatterers from a nonlinear inverse problem in two steps, using either single or multiple illuminations. We further introduce an approach that uses the top singular vectors of the response matrix as optimal illuminations, which improves the robustness of sparse promoting optimization with respect to additive noise. When multiple scattering is negligible, the optimization problem becomes linear and can be reduced to a hybrid-ℓ1 method when optimal illuminations are used. When the media is random, and the interaction with the unknown inhomogeneities can be primarily modeled by wavefront distortions, we address the statistical stability of these methods. We analyze the fluctuations of the images obtained with the hybrid-ℓ1 method, and we show that it is stable with respect to different realizations of the random medium provided the imaging array is large enough. We compare the performance of the hybrid-ℓ1 method in random media to the widely used Kirchhoff migration and the multiple signal classification methods. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK.},

abstract={We introduce the one-way radiative transfer equation (RTE) for modeling the transmission of a light beam incident normally on a slab composed of a uniform forward-peaked scattering medium. Unlike the RTE, which is formulated as a boundary value problem, the one-way RTE is formulated as an initial value problem. Consequently, the one-way RTE is much easier to solve. We discuss the relation of the one-way RTE to the Fokker-Planck, small-angle, and Fermi pencil beam approximations. Then, we validate the one-way RTE through systematic comparisons with RTE simulations for both the Henyey-Greenstein and screened Rutherford scattering phase functions over a broad range of albedo, anisotropy factor, optical thickness, and refractive index values. We find that the one-way RTE gives very good approximations for a broad range of optical property values for thin to moderately thick media that have moderately to sharply forward-peaked scattering. Specifically, we show that the error made by the one-way RTE decreases monotonically as the anisotropic factor increases and as the albedo increases. On the other hand, the error increases monotonically as the optical thickness increases and the refractive index mismatch at the boundary increases. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A Monte Carlo algorithm is derived to solve the one-dimensional telegraph equations in a bounded domain subject to resistive and non-resistive boundary conditions. The proposed numerical scheme is more efficient than the classical Kac's theory because it does not require the discretization of time. The algorithm has been validated by comparing the results obtained with theory and the Finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method for a typical two-wire transmission line terminated at both ends with general boundary conditions. We have also tested transmission line heterogeneities to account for wave propagation in multiple media. The algorithm is inherently parallel, since it is based on Monte Carlo simulations, and does not suffer from the numerical dispersion and dissipation issues that arise in finite difference-based numerical schemes on a lossy medium. This allowed us to develop an efficient numerical method, capable of outperforming the classical FDTD method for large scale problems and high frequency signals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

Imaging Sci., 8 (2015), pp. 1547-1573], where we showed that using linear combinations of intensity-only measurements, obtained from N2 illuminations, imaging of localized scatterers can be carried out efficiently using imaging methods based on the singular value decomposition of the time-reversal matrix. Here we show that the same strategy can be accomplished with only 3N - 2 illuminations, therefore enormously reducing the data acquisition process. Furthermore, we show that in the paraxial regime one can form the images by using six illuminations only. In particular, this paraxial regime includes Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. The key point of this work is that if one controls the illuminations, imaging with intensity only can be easily reduced to an imaging with phases and, therefore, one can apply standard imaging techniques. Detailed numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed imaging strategy with and without data noise. © 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract={A numerical model based on radial basis function-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) is developed for simulating the global electric circuit (GEC) within the Earth's atmosphere, represented by a 3-D variable coefficient linear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) in a spherically shaped volume with the lower boundary being the Earth's topography and the upper boundary a sphere at 60 km. To our knowledge, this is (1) the first numerical model of the GEC to combine the Earth's topography with directly approximating the differential operators in 3-D space and, related to this, (2) the first RBF-FD method to use irregular 3-D stencils for discretization to handle the topography. It benefits from the mesh-free nature of RBF-FD, which is especially suitable for modeling high-dimensional problems with irregular boundaries. The RBF-FD elliptic solver proposed here makes no limiting assumptions on the spatial variability of the coefficients in the PDE (i.e., the conductivity profile), the right hand side forcing term of the PDE (i.e., distribution of current sources) or the geometry of the lower boundary. © Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={We present a computational study of diffuse optical tomography using the one-way radiative transfer equation. The one-way radiative transfer is a simplification of the radiative transfer equation to approximate the transmission of light through tissues. The major simplification of this approximation is that the intensity satisfies an initial value problem rather than a boundary value problem. Consequently, the inverse problem to reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients from transmission measurements of scattered light is simplified. Using the initial value problem for the one-way radiative transfer equation to compute the forward model, we are able to quantitatively reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients efficiently and effectively for simple problems and obtain reasonable results for complicated problems. © 2015 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={The reconstruction of cardiac ischemic regions from body surface potential measurements (BSPMs) is usually performed at a single time instant which corresponds to the plateau or resting phase of the cardiac action potential. Using a different approach, we previously proposed a level set formulation that incorporates the knowledge of the cardiac excitation process in the inverse procedure, thus exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations contained in the BSPMs. In this study, we extend our inverse level-set formulation for the reconstruction of ischemic regions to 3D realistic geometries, and analyze its performance in different noisy scenarios. Our method is benchmarked against zero-order Tikhonov regularization. The inverse reconstruction of the ischemic region is evaluated using the correlation coefficient (CC), the sensitive error ratio (SN), and the specificity error ratio (SP). Our algorithm outperforms zero-order Tikhonov regularization, specially in highly noisy scenarios. © 2015 CCAL.},

abstract={The inverse problem of electrocardiography (IPE) has been formulated in different ways in order to non invasively obtain valuable informations about the heart condition. Most of the formulations solve the IPE neglecting the dynamic behavior of the electrical wave propagation in the heart. In this work we take into account this dynamic behavior by constraining the cost function with the monodomain model. We use an iterative algorithm combined with a level set formulation and the use of a simple phenomenological model. This method has been previously presented to localize ischemic regions in a 2D cardiac tissue. In this work, we analyze the performance of this method in different 3D geometries. The inverse procedure exploits the spatiotemporal correlations contained in the observed data, which is formulated as a parametric adjust of a mathematical model that minimizes the misfit between the simulated and the observed data. Numerical results over 3D geometries show that the algorithm is capable of identifying the position and the size of the ischemic regions. For the experiments with a realistic anatomical geometry, we reconstruct the ischemic region with roughly a 47% of falsepositive rate and a 13% false-negative rate under 10% of input noise. The correlation coefficient between the reconstructed ischemic region and the ground truth exceeds the value of 0.70). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={We propose a new approach to avoid the inherent ill-condition in the computation of RBF-FD weights, which is due to the fact that the RBF interpolation matrix is nearly singular. The new approach is based on the semi-analytical computation of the Laurent series of the inverse of the RBF interpolation matrix. Once the Laurent series is obtained, it can be used to compute the RBF-FD weights of any differential operator exactly without extra cost. The proposed method also provides analytical formulas for the RBF-FD weights in terms of the parameters involved in the problem. These formulas can be used to derive the exact dependence of the truncation error in the approximation of any differential operator of a given function. Furthermore, from the analysis presented here one can derive the values of the parameters involved in the problem for which the RBF interpolation matrix becomes ill-conditioned and, hence, for which the weights cannot be obtained numerically. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our algorithm is stochastic in nature and as such fully parallelizable. It is intended to extract capacitance entries directly from a pixelized representation of the integrated circuit (IC), which can be produced from a scanning electron microscopy image. Preprocessing and monitoring of the capacitance calculation are kept to a minimum, thanks to the use of distance maps automatically generated with a fast marching technique. Numerical validation of the algorithm shows that the systematic error of the algorithm decreases with better resolution of the input image. Those features render the presented algorithm well suited for fast prototyping while using the most realistic IC geometry data. © 2014 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract={We study active array imaging of small but strong scatterers in homogeneous media when multiple scattering between them is important. We use the Foldy-Lax equations to model wave propagation with multiple scattering when the scatterers are small relative to the wavelength. In active array imaging we seek to locate the positions and reflectivities of the scatterers, that is, to determine the support of the reflectivity vector and the values of its nonzero elements from echoes recorded on the array. This is a nonlinear inverse problem because of the multiple scattering. In this paper, we show how to avoid the nonlinearity and form images noniteratively through a two-step process which involves l norm minimization. However, under certain illuminations imaging may be affected by screening, where some scatterers are obscured by multiple scattering. This problem can be mitigated by using multiple and diverse illuminations. In this case, we determine solution vectors that have a common support. The uniqueness and stability of the support of the reflectivity vector obtained with single or multiple illuminations are analyzed, showing that the errors are proportional to the amount of noise in the data with a proportionality factor dependent on the sparsity of the solution and the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix, which is determined by the geometry of the imaging array. Finally, to filter out noise and improve the resolution of the images, we propose an approach that combines optimal illuminations using the singular value decomposition of the response matrix together with sparsity promoting optimization jointly for all illuminations. In this work, an extension of our previous paper [A. Chai, M. Moscoso, and G. Papanicolaou, Inverse Problems, 29 (2013), 025016] on imaging using optimization techniques, we now account for multiple scattering effects. © 2014 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

The selection of the optimal shape parameter is based on analytical approximations to the local error using either the same shape parameter at all nodes or a node-dependent shape parameter. We show through several examples using both equispaced and nonequispaced nodes that significant gains in accuracy result from a proper selection of the shape parameter. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The Inverse Problem of electrocardiography (IPE) can be summarized as the characterization of the electrical behavior of the heart using measurements obtained by electrodes that are not directly in contact with the cardiac surfaces. Given a data ensemble provided by electrodes, the solution of the IPE requires the design of a mathematical procedure that matches a theoretical model of estimated measurements with that ensemble of data. Common tests of inversion procedures were often made with synthetic data using the same model for computing both predicted and estimated measurements, yielding into overoptimistic results; this is called the Inverse Crime. In practice, the test of an inversion process avoiding the Inverse Crime could be done using a model for the numerically produced simulated data and a different one to invert the data. This work shows the behavior of a procedure designed to characterize regions in the heart with a lack of blood supply (ischemia) avoiding the Inverse Crime. Realistic and experimentally supported models constitute the forward procedure (the Luo-Rudy model for the electrical activity and the volume conductor theory for simulating the electrode measurements) while a simple phenomenological model (the two-current model proposed by Mitchell and Schaeffer) is used during the inversion process. © 2013 CCAL.},

abstract={Laminar flame propagation is an important problem in combustion modelling for which great advances have been achieved both in its theoretical understanding and in the numerical solution of the governing equations in 2D and 3D. Most of these numerical simulations use finite difference techniques on simple geometries (channels, ducts,...) with equispaced nodes. The objective of this work is to explore the applicability of the radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method to laminar flame propagation modelling. This method is specially well suited for the solution of problems with complex geometries and irregular boundaries. Another important advantage is that the method is independent of the dimension of the problem and, therefore, it is very easy to apply in 3D problems with complex geometries. In this work we use the RBF-FD method to compute 2D and 3D numerical results that simulate premixed laminar flames with different Lewis numbers propagating in open ducts. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={An efficient numerical method based on a probabilistic representation for the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations in the Fourier space has been derived. This has been done theoretically for arbitrary dimensional problems, and particularized to unidimensional problems for numerical purposes. Such a representation has been validated theoretically in the linear regime comparing the solution obtained with the classical results of the linear Landau damping.The numerical strategy followed requires generating suitable random trees combined with a Padé approximant for approximating accurately a given divergent series. Such series are obtained by summing the partial contributions to the solution coming from trees with arbitrary number of branches. These contributions, coming in general from multi-dimensional definite integrals, are efficiently computed by a quasi-Monte Carlo method. It is shown how the accuracy of the method can be effectively increased by considering more terms of the series.The new representation was used successfully to develop a Probabilistic Domain Decomposition method suited for massively parallel computers, which improves the scalability found in classical methods. Finally, a few numerical examples based on classical phenomena such as the non-linear Landau damping, and the two streaming instability are given, illustrating the remarkable performance of the algorithm, when compared the results with those obtained using a classical method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We show that for large arrays, with array diameter comparable to range, and when scatterers are sparse and well separated, ℓ1 minimization using a single illumination and without additive noise can recover the location and reflectivity of the scatterers exactly. For multiple illuminations, we introduce a hybrid method which combines the singular value decomposition and ℓ1 minimization. This method can be used when the essential singular vectors of the array response matrix are available. We show that with this hybrid method we can recover the location and reflectivity of the scatterers exactly when there is no noise in the data.

abstract={In this paper, we study the possibility of using lifetime data to estimate the position and orientation of a fluorescent dipole source within a disordered medium. The vector Foldy-Lax equations are employed to calculate the interaction between the fluorescent source and the scatterers that are modeled as point-scatterers. The numerical experiments demonstrate that if good prior knowledge about the positions of the scatterers is available, the position and orientation of the dipole source can be retrieved from its lifetime data with precision. If there is uncertainty about the positions of the scatterers, the dipole source position can be estimated within the same level of uncertainty. © 2013 Optical Society of America.},

This method is specially well suited for the solution of problems with complex geometries and irregular boundaries where spectral methods can not be applied. Another important advantage is that the method is independent of the dimension of the problem and, therefore, it is very easy to apply in 3D problems with complex geometries. We use both the global and the local (RBF-FD) versions of the method and we show its applicability in the solution of flame propagation problems in one, two and three dimensions using equispaced and non-equispaced nodes. © 2013 WIT Press.},

abstract={In this follow up paper to our previous study in Bayona et al. (2011) [2], we present a new technique to compute the solution of PDEs with the multiquadric based RBF finite difference method (RBF-FD) using an optimal node dependent variable value of the shape parameter. This optimal value is chosen so that, to leading order, the local approximation error of the RBF-FD formulas is zero. In our previous paper (Bayona et al., 2011) [2] we considered the case of an optimal (constant) value of the shape parameter for all the nodes. Our new results show that, if one allows the shape parameter to be different at each grid point of the domain, one may obtain very significant accuracy improvements with a simple and inexpensive numerical technique. We analyze the same examples studied in Bayona et al. (2011) [2], both with structured and unstructured grids, and compare our new results with those obtained previously. We also find that, if there are a significant number of nodes for which no optimal value of the shape parameter exists, then the improvement in accuracy deteriorates significantly. In those cases, we use generalized multiquadrics as RBFs and choose the exponent of the multiquadric at each node to assure the existence of an optimal variable shape parameter. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Hence, it is desirable to exploit the spatio-temporal correlations contained in the data.

In order to take into account the electrophysiological alterations of ischemic regions, we also introduce appropriate variations of the model parameters. This approach allows us to perform the reconstruction of the affected regions successfully using only a few recording sites. The reconstruction process is based on level set techniques.

Included in this analysis is the derivation of a boundary layer solution that corrects the diffusion approximation near the boundaries and provides the means to derive boundary conditions for the diffusion approximation. We give an explicit solution for this boundary layer solution in terms of plane wave solutions that we calculate numerically using the discrete ordinate method.

The strategy shown in this reference permits to detect and characterize the tumors of 1 cm diameter situated deeply inside the dense breast if the contrast between dielectric permittivity of tumor and surrounding tissue is at least 1.5. However, in some cases [2], experimentally, it has been reported that the contrast can be lower. Therefore, we consider cases in which low contrast leads to more difficult reconstructions. Our study of limitations of algorithm shows that by mean of additional regularization by using prior average values of dielectric parameters in human breast, even in case of contrast 1.2, the detection of 1 cm tumors is robust. Our contribution is to show that statistical criteria during the tumor search in cases when the average dielectric properties are not available, leads to localization of tumor and its separation from reconstruction 'ghosts'. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Two different strategies have been proposed, both requiring generating suitable random trees combined with a Pade approximant for approximating accurately a given divergent series. Such series are obtained by summing the partial contribution to the solution coming from trees with arbitrary number of branches. The new representation greatly expands the class of problems amenable to be solved probabilistically, and was used successfully to develop a generalized probabilistic domain decomposition method. Such a method has been shown to be suited for massively parallel computers, enjoying full scalability and fault tolerance.

abstract={Radial basis functions (RBFs) have become a popular method for interpolation and solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Many types of RBFs used in these problems contain a shape parameter, and there is much experimental evidence showing that accuracy strongly depends on the value of this shape parameter. In this paper, we focus on PDE problems solved with a multiquadric based RBF finite difference (RBF-FD) method. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal value of the shape parameter that minimizes the approximation error. The algorithm is based on analytical approximations to the local RBF-FD error derived in [1]. We show through several examples in 1D and 2D, both with structured and unstructured nodes, that very accurate solutions (compared to finite differences) can be achieved using the optimal value of the constant shape parameter. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We reformulate this intensity-only imaging problem as a non-convex optimization problem and show that we can have exact recovery by minimizing the rank of a positive semidefinite matrix associated with the unknown reflectivities. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard and is computationally intractable, we replace the rank of the matrix by its nuclear norm, the sum of its singular values, which is a convex programming problem that can be solved in polynomial time.

abstract={This paper presents the practical experience of parallelizing a simulator of general scattering and radiation electromagnetic problems. The simulator stems from an existing sequential simulator in the frequency domain, which is based on a finite element analysis. After the analysis of a test case, two steps were carried out: first, a "hand-crafted" code parallelization of a convolution-type operation was developed within the kernel of the simulator. Second, the sequential HSL library, used in the existing simulator, was replaced by the parallel MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) library in order to solve the associated linear algebra problem in parallel. Such a library allows for the distribution of the factorized matrix and some of the computational load among the available processors. A test problem and three realistic (in terms of the number of unknowns) cases have been run using the parallelized version of the code, and the results are presented and discussed focusing on the memory usage and achieved speed-up. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The Motz problem can be considered as a benchmark problem for testing the performance of numerical methods in the solution of elliptic problems with boundary singularities. The purpose of this paper is to address the solution of the Motz problem using the radial basis function (RBF) method, which is a truly meshfree scheme. Design/methodology/approach - Both the global RBF collocation method (also known as Kansa's method) and the recently proposed local RBF-based differential quadrature (LRBFDQ) method are considered. In both cases, it is shown that the accuracy of the solution can be significantly increased by using special functions which capture the behavior of the singularity. In the case of global collocation, the functional space spanned by the RBF is enlarged by adding singular functions which capture the behavior of the local singular solution. In the case of local collocation, the problem is modified appropriately in order to eliminate the singularities from the formulation. Findings - The paper shows that the exponential convergence both with increasing resolution and increasing shape parameter, which is typical of the RBF method, is lost in problems containing singularities.The accuracyof the solution can be increased bycollocation of the partial differential equation (PDE) at boundary nodes.However, in order to restore the exponential convergence of theRBFmethod, it is necessary to use special functions which capture the behavior of the solution near the discontinuity. Practical implications - The paper uses Motz's problem as a prototype for problems described byelliptic partial differential equations with boundary singularities. However, the results obtained in the paper are applicable to a wide range of problems containing boundaries with conditions which change from Dirichlet to Neumann, thus leading to singularities in the first derivatives. Originality/value - The paper shows that both the global RBF collocation method and the LRBFDQ method, are truly meshless methods which can be very useful for the solution of elliptic problems with boundary singularities. In particular, when complemented with special functions that capture the behavior of the solution near the discontinuity, the method exhibits exponential convergence both with resolution and with shape parameter. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

To compute cross correlations of the impulse signals collected by the receivers, we consider scattering by discrete scatterers to generate impluse responses with targets and without targets. We compute the difference of the cross correlations with targets and the cross correlations without targets to estimate the backpropagator (Green's function) in the Kirchhoff migration functional.

abstract={Nowadays supercomputers have already entered in the petascale computing era and peak rate performance is dramatically increasing year after year. However, most of current algorithms are not capable of exploiting fully such a technology due to the well-known parallel programming related issues, such as synchronization, communication and fault tolerance. The aim of this paper is to present a probabilistic domain decomposition algorithm based on generating suitable random trees for solving nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. These are of paramount importance since many important scientific and engineering problems are modeled by such type of differential equations. We stress that such algorithm is perfectly suited for both current and future high performance supercomputers, showing a remarkable performance and arbitrary scalability. While classical algorithms based on a deterministic domain decomposition exhibits strong limitations when increasing the size of the problem and the number of processors involved, probabilistic methods rather allow us to exploit efficiently massively parallel architectures, being the problem fully decoupled.

abstract={We present a new inversion strategy for the early detection of breast cancer from microwave data which is based on a new multiphase level set technique. This novel structural inversion method uses a modification of the color level set technique adapted to the specific situation of structural breast imaging taking into account the high complexity of the breast tissue. We only use data of a few microwave frequencies for detecting the tumors hidden in this complex structure. Three level set functions are employed for describing four different types of breast tissue, where each of these four regions is allowed to have a complicated topology and to have an interior structure which needs to be estimated from the data simultaneously with the region interfaces. The algorithm consists of several stages of increasing complexity. In each stage more details about the anatomical structure of the breast interior is incorporated into the inversion model. The synthetic breast models which are used for creating simulated data are based on real MRI images of the breast and are therefore quite realistic. Our results demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed level set technique for detecting, locating and characterizing a small tumor in its early stage of development embedded in such a realistic breast model.

We derive exact formulas for the first and second derivatives in one dimension, and for the Laplacian in two dimensions. Using these formulas we compute Taylor expansions for the error. From this analysis, we find that there is an optimal value of the shape parameter for which the error is minimum. This optimal parameter is independent of the nodal distance.

abstract={We present a level-set based technique to recover key characteristics of a defect or crack (e.g. location, length and shape) in a two-dimensional material from boundary electrical measurements. The key feature of this work is to extend the usual level-set technique for modeling volumetric objects to very thin objects. Two level-set functions are employed: the first one models the location and form of the crack, and the second one models its length and connectivity. An efficient gradient based method is derived in order to define evolution laws for these two level-set functions which minimize the least squares data misfit. Numerical experiments show the utility of this method even in the presence of a significant noise level in the measurements. A finite element method is used to simulate the electric field behavior in the presence of very thin objects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A domain decomposition method is developed for the numerical solution of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations in any space dimension, based on the probabilistic representation of solutions as an average of suitable multiplicative functionals. Such a direct probabilistic representation requires generating a number of random trees, whose role is that of the realizations of stochastic processes used in the linear problems. First, only few values of the sought solution inside the space-time domain are computed (by a Monte Carlo method on the trees). An interpolation is then carried out, in order to approximate interfacial values of the solution inside the domain. Thus, a fully decoupled set of sub-problems is obtained. The algorithm is suited to massively parallel implementation, enjoying arbitrary scalability and fault tolerance properties. Pruning the trees is shown to increase appreciably the efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical examples conducted in 2D, including some for the KPP equation, are given. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The performance of Kansa's method in the solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with singular boundary conditions is addressed. Like in all global numerical schemes, low-order singularities bring about Gibbs' oscillations that deteriorate the accuracy and the convergence rate of Kansa's method to a great extent. Moreover, they may render it uncapable of handling common problems of incompressible flow. Focussing on a problem of Laplacian flow which is linked to the benchmark Motz problem, it is shown how all these difficulties can be overcome by enriching the radial basis function (RBF) interpolant with the proper singularity-capturing terms. This simple modification even enables Kansa's method to outperform the finite element method (FEM) in the conservation of Laplacian flow through an irregular channel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The last four models listed are approximations of the radiative transport equation that take into account forward-peaked scattering analytically. Using simulated data from the numerical solution of radiative transport equation, we solve the inverse problem for the absorption and scattering coefficients using the transport-backtransport method. Through comparison of the numerical results, we show that all of these light scattering models produce good image reconstructions. In addition, we show that these approximations afford considerable computational savings over solving the radiative transport equation. However, all of the models exhibit significant "crosstalk" between absorption and scattering coefficient images. Among the approximations, we have found that the generalized Fokker-Planck- Eddington equation produced the best image reconstructions in comparison with the image reconstructions produced by the radiative transport equation. © 2009 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={We study multiple scattering of partially polarized light using the theory of radiative transport. In particular, we study the light that exits a half-space composed of a uniform absorbing and scattering medium due to an unpolarized, isotropic, and continuous planar source. We assume that Rayleigh scattering applies. Using only angular integrals of the two orthogonal polarization components of the intensity exiting the half-space, we recover the depth and the strength of this source in two stages. First, we recover the depth of the source through the solution of a one-dimensional nonlinear equation. Then we recover the strength of the source through the solution of a linear least-squares problem. This method is limited to sources located at depths on the order of a transport mean-free path or less. Beyond that depth, these data do not contain sufficient polarization diversity for this inversion method to work. In addition, we show that this method is sensitive to instrument noise.

abstract={In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel shape reconstruction technique for the early detection of breast cancer from microwave data, which is based on a level-set technique. The shape-based approach offers several advantages compared to more traditional pixel-based approaches when targeting the reconstruction of key characteristics of a hidden tumor such as its correct size, shape, and static permittivity value. In addition to these key characteristics of hidden tumors, we aim at estimating the correct interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular tissue in the breast and their internal permittivity profiles. The level set strategy (which is an implicit representation of the shapes) frees us from topological restrictions when reconstructing an a priori arbitrary number of tumors and the often quite complicated interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular regions. The presented strategy is able to detect and, in most cases, characterize tumors whose sizes (diameters) are much smaller than the wavelengths of the electromagnetic waves that are used for illuminating the breast. We present numerical results for a 2-D model with two distinct tissue types (fatty and fibroglandular) in the interior of the breast (in addition to a possible tumor and the surrounding skin). Our results demonstrate the performance and potential of our scheme in various simulated but realistic situations. © 2006 IEEE.},

The simulator stems from an existing sequential simulator in the frequency domain and can be fruitfully used in applications such as the test of coverage of a wireless net- work, analysis of complex structures, and so on. After the analysis of a test case, two steps were carried out: firstly, a "hand-crafted" code parallelisation was developed within the kernel of the simulator. Secondly, the sequential library, used in the existing simulator, was replaced by the parallel MUMPS library in order to solve the associated linear al- gebra problem in parallel. For factorising the matrix with MUMPS, two different ordering methods have been consid- ered. Copyright © 2009 ICST.},

abstract={In this work we present a novel level set technique for shape reconstruction in history matching for reservoirs with two or more kinds of rocks (the so-called lithofacies) using stochastic initializations. In the paper we discuss the use of sequential Gaussian simulation for the creation of geostatistical initial guesses which will then be applied to an earlier introduced level set based shape reconstruction algorithm for the history matching problem in reservoir characterization. The shapes or regions with sharp interfaces to each other are represented by a level set function which needs to be determined from the production data gathered at few locations of the reservoir. We present numerical results in 2D which demonstrate that our method is able to provide reliable estimates of this structure from these relatively few production data even though the topology of the unknown regions is a priori unknown. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we analyze the scalability and performance of a probabilistic domain decomposition strategy for solving linear elliptic boundary-value problems. Such a strategy consists of a hybrid numerical scheme based on a probabilistic method along with a domain decomposition, and full decoupling can be accomplished. It is shown that such a method performs well for an arbitrarily large number of processors, while the classical deterministic approach is strongly affected by intercommunications. Therefore, the overall performance degrades dramatically for rather large number of processors. Furthermore, we find that the probabilistic method is scalable as the number of subdomains, i.e., the number of processors involved, increases. This fact is clearly illustrated by an example. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Because this combination of the forward-peaked and large-angle scattering makes it difficult to solve the radiative transport equation, we present a method to construct approximations to study this problem. The delta-Eddington and Fokker-Planck approximations are special cases of this general framework. Using this approximation method, we derive two new approximations: the Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation and the generalized Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation.

In practice, these measurements are incomplete and inaccurate leading to ill-posed problems. This means that 'exact' reconstructions are usually not possible. In this Introduction the reader will find some applications in which the main ideas about stability and resolution in image reconstruction are discussed. We will see that although different applications or imaging modalities work under different physical principles and map different physical parameters, they all share the same mathematical foundations and the tools used to create the images have a great deal in common. Current imaging problems deal with understanding the trade off between data size, the quality of the image and the computational tools used to create the image. In many cases, these tools represent the performance bottleneck due to the high operational count and the memory cost. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, very intensive efforts have been devoted to develop meshless or element free methods that eliminate the need of element connectivity in the solution of PDEs. The motivation is to cut down modelling costs in industrial applications by avoiding the labor intensive step of mesh generation. In addition, these methods are particularly attractive in problems with moving interfaces since no remeshing is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem of injection molding described as a free boundary problem defined by conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy. This model can be dramatically simplified assuming that the mould is thin so that a Hele-Shaw approximation can be used. In this case the momentum equation is just a 2D elliptic equation whose solution yields the pressure distribution in the filled region of the mould. From this pressure field, the velocity distribution can be computed and the location of the advancing front can be updated. Therefore, this problem is very well suited to meshfree techniques and, in this paper, we use a radial basis function (RBF) method which is based on the interpolation and collocation of global shape functions, and for simplicity assume a Newtonian fluid so that the model is linear. In particular, we use multiquadric (MQ) RBFs which have been shown to have exponential convergence. To advance the front we use a level set method which is very efficient for this type of problems because it is very fast and can handle both front collisions and front break-ups without difficulty.},

abstract={Recent endocardial mapping systems reconstruct an instantaneous image of the endocardial electrical activity performing the inverse problem of electrocardiography (IPE), which consists ofestimating the endocardial surface potentials from intracavitary probe potentials. Even though the IPE has been long studied, it still being paid attention due to its ill-posed nature, and many different regularization techniques have been explored in this setting. In this study we analyzed Support Vector machines (SVM) as an alternative regularization technique regarding their robustness against ill-posed problems. We propose here two new SVM algorithms, specifically adapted to the ill-posing issues ofthe IPE, and develop the equations for endocar- dial mapping oftransmembrane currents. We show, both in simple simulations and in a previously developed cellular automata, that the ill-posing robustness ofthe SVM is higher when compared to regularized approaches during the depolarization phase. In conclusion, the properties ofthe developed SVM algorithms stand for an appropriate framework for addressing the IPE.},

Our algorithm uses a level set representation of shapes describing different lithofacies in the reservoir. These shapes need to be reconstructed from the production data using a two-phase flow model. In order to deal with regions of low sensitivity, topological perturbations are applied successively during the reconstruction in these low sensitivity regions, and the level set technique will evolve the so created shapes following a gradient direction that minimizes the mismatch between the computed and the production data. New shapes created at wrong locations tend to disappear gradually, whereas those created at locations where a lithofacie is present tend to grow until they approximately match the correct boundaries. We will discuss different strategies and present numerical results which demonstrate and compare their performances for two realistic 2D test cases. © de Gruyter 2007.},

abstract={In this paper we consider the problem of injecting a non-Newtonian fluid into a thin cavity. Using the Hele-Shaw approximation the problem reduces to a moving boundary problem in which the pressure is described by a 2D, nonlinear, elliptic equation. Mesh-free methods are very well suited for the numerical solution of moving boundary problems since no remeshing is needed at each time step to correctly represent the boundary. Among these methods, we have chosen the asymmetric RBF collocation method (Kansa's method) to compute the pressure distribution. Kansa's method is truly mesh-free, and is one of the most frequently used methods due to its accuracy and ease of implementation. Once the pressure is known, the velocity at each point in the moving front is computed and, therefore, the location of the front can be updated. To efficiently model the front motion we use the level set method, which is very accurate, and can handle both front collisions and front break-ups without difficulty. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A hybrid numerical scheme based on a probabilistic method along with a classical domain decomposition is proposed for solving numerically linear elliptic boundary-value problems. Full decoupling can be accomplished by computing a few values of the solution inside the domain by Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo techniques, and interpolating at the nodal points where the solution has been obtained previously. Thus, this method appears to be fault-tolerant as well as suited for time decomposition. Some examples are shown to illustrate performance and scalability.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a new kind of domain decomposition strategy for solving linear elliptic boundary-value problems. It outperforms the traditional ones in complex and heterogeneous networks like those for grid computing. Such a strategy consists of a hybrid numerical scheme based on a probabilistic method along with a domain decomposition, and full decoupling can be accomplished. While the deterministic approach is strongly affected by intercommunication among the hosts, the probabilistic method is scalable as the number of subdomains, i.e., the number of processors involved, increases. This fact is clearly illustrated by an example, even operating in a grid environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={We solve direct and inverse obstacle-scattering problems in a half-space composed of a uniform absorbing and scattering medium. Scattering is sharply forward-peaked, so we use the modified Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative transport equation. The obstacle is an absorbing inhomogeneity that is thin with respect to depth. Using the first Born approximation, we derive a method to recover the depth and shape of the absorbing obstacle. This method requires only plane-wave illumination at two incidence angles and a detector with a fixed numerical aperture. First we recover the depth of the obstacle through solution of a simple non-linear least-squares problem. Using that depth, we compute a point-spread function explicitly. We use that point-spread function in a standard deconvolution algorithm to reconstruct the shape of the obstacle. Numerical results show the utility of this method even in the presence of measurement noise. © 2007 Optical Society of America.},

A typical feature is the appearance of second harmonics effects. An asymptotic statistical analysis for these oscillators is performed in the diffusion limit, when a suitable absorbing boundary condition is imposed, according to the underlying physical problem. The related Fokker-Planck equation has been numerically solved to obtain the first two moments of the oscillator's displacement from its rest-position. Dependence on the nonlinearity strength and on the location of the absorbing boundary has also been investigated.

abstract={An important technique in modern reservoir management is the use of production data for the characterization of permeability distributions with more than one lithology from production data. A major difficulty which arises in these situations is that sharp discontinuities of permeabilities between these lithofacies need to be reconstructed at the same time with more smoothly varying profiles inside of them. So far, techniques have been developed which recover either the interfaces or a smoothly varying profile, but not both of them. Our group has developed recently a novel method for modelling and reconstructing geological shapes in reservoirs from production data. This method is based on a level set representation of the shapes. In our previous work1,2 we have assumed that the permeability distribution in the different regions of the reservoirs do not vary significantly such that they can be approximated by a constant value which was approximately known from prior information. In this paper we will present an extension of this new method which is able to recover at the same time the shapes of the different geological regions and variations of the permeability distribution in each of these regions. In each step of our new reconstruction technique the production data are used in order to calculate an update for the shape of the two lithofacies and at the same time a pixel-based correction of the parameter profiles inside of these regions. Only one simulation of a two-phase flow simulator and a corresponding adjoint simulator are necessary for calculating both updates. In our paper we will present numerical results in 2D for realistic situations of a water flooding process. We show that our method is able to reconstruct two lithofacies of complicated shape and the corresponding permeability distributions simultaneously from these production data.

In particular we consider a two-layered medium in which a finite slab is situated on top of a half space. We solve the one-dimensional problem in which a plane wave is incident normally on the top layer and is the only source of light. The solution to this problem is obtained formally by imposing continuity between the solutions for the upper and lower layers. However, we are interested solely in probing the top layer. Assuming that the optical properties in the lower layer are known, we remove it from the problem yielding a finite slab problem by prescribing an alternate boundary condition. This boundary condition is derived using the theory of Green's functions and is exact. Hence, one needs only to solve the transport equation in a finite slab using this alternate boundary condition. We derive an asymptotic solution for the case when the slab is optically thin. We extend these results to the three-dimensional problem using Fourier transforms. These results are validated by comparisons with numerical solutions for the entire two-layered problem. 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

abstract={We study theoretically light backscattered by tissues using the radiative transport equation. In particular we consider a twolayered medium in which a finite slab is situated on top of a half space. We solve the one-dimensional problem in which a plane wave is incident normally on the top layer and is the only source of light. The solution to this problem is obtained formally by imposing continuity between the solutions for the upper and lower layers. However, we are interested solely in probing the top layer. Assuming that the optical properties in the lower layer are known, we remove it from the problem yielding a finite slab problem by prescribing an alternate boundary condition. This boundary condition is derived using the theory of Green's functions and is exact. Hence, one needs only to solve the transport equation in a finite slab using this alternate boundary condition. We derive an asymptotic solution for the case when the slab is optically thin. We extend these results to the three-dimensional problem using Fourier transforms. These results are validated by comparisons with numerical solutions for the entire two-layered problem. © 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

abstract={This paper describes the application of the adjoint method to the history matching problem in reservoir engineering. The history matching problem consists in adjusting a set of parameters, in this case the permeability distribution, in order to match the data obtained with the simulator to the actual production data in the reservoir. Several numerical experiments are presented which show that our method is able to reconstruct the unknown permeability distribution in a reliable and efficient way from synthetic data provided by an independent numerical forward modelling code. An efficient and flexible regularization scheme is introduced as well, which stabilizes the inversion and enables the reservoir engineer to incorporate certain types of prior information into the final result. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={It is well known that overdamped unforced dynamical systems do not oscillate. However, well-designed coupling schemes, together with the appropriate choice of initial conditions, can induce oscillations when a control parameter exceeds a threshold value. In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. E, 68, 045102(R) (2003)], we demonstrated this behavior in a specific prototype system, a soft-potential mean-field description of the dynamics in a hysteretic “single-domain” ferromagnetic sample. The previous analysis of this work showed that [Formula presented] (odd) unidirectionally coupled elements with cyclic boundary conditions would, in fact, oscillate when a control parameter—in this case the coupling strength—exceeded a critical value. These oscillations are now finding utility in the detection of very weak “target” signals, via their effect on the oscillation characteristics, e.g., the frequency and asymmetry of the oscillation wave forms. In this paper we explore the underlying dynamics of this system. Scaling laws that govern the oscillation frequency in the vicinity of the critical point, as well as the zero-crossing intervals in the presence of a symmetry-breaking target dc signal, are derived; these quantities are germane to signal detection and analysis. © 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={We study a system of globally coupled two-dimensional nonlinear oscillators [using the two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) as a prototype for a single element] each of which can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation characterized by the disappearance of the stable minima in its potential energy function. This transition from fixed point solutions to spontaneous oscillations is controlled by external bias parameters, including the coupling coefficient. For the deterministic case, an extension of a center-manifold reduction, carried out earlier for the single oscillator, yields an oscillation frequency that depends on the coupling; the frequency decreases with coupling strength and/or the number of oscillators. In the presence of noise, a mean-field description leads to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation for the system which is investigated for experimentally realistic noise levels. Furthermore, we apply a weak external time-sinusoidal probe signal to each oscillator and use the resulting (classical) resonance to determine the underlying frequency of the noisy system. This leads to an explanation of earlier experimental results as well as the possibility of designing a more sensitive SQUID-based detection system. © 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Curing of epoxy resins with aliphatic diamines at low temperatures deviates from the 4EQ mechanism (catalytic and non-catalytic dual path) at relatively low conversions, far from vitrification. Although the Horie mechanism relies on a third order reaction it is possible a more realistic approach to epoxy curing kinetics if a detailed analysis of auto-acceleration is made. A single parameter dependent only on the nature of the amine is proposed.},

It is the result of successive near-forward-scattering events that maintain the incident wave's helicity. For moderately large scatterers it exhibits a simple dependence on the anisotropy factor.

abstract={We study the performance of Chebyshev spectral methods for time-dependent radiative transfer equations. Starting with a method for one-dimensional problems in homogeneous media, we show that the modifications needed to consider more general problems such as inhomogeneous media, polarization, and higher dimensions are straightforward. In this method, we approximate the spatial dependence of the intensity by an expansion of Chebyshev polynomials. This yields a coupled system of integro-differential equations for the expansion coefficients that depend on angle and time. Next, we approximate the integral operation on the angle variables using a Gaussian quadrature rule resulting in a coupled system of differential equations with respect to time. Using a second-order finite difference approximation, we discretize the time variable. We solve the resultant system of equations with an efficient algorithm that makes Chebyshev spectral methods competitive with other methods for radiative transfer equations.},

The ability to quantify the oscillation frequency permits its exploitation as a detection/analysis tool in remote sensing applications. Here we present quantitative results about such oscillation frequency and its scaling in terms of the control parameters, and the number of SQUIDs involved. For infinitely many coupled SQUIDs, the thermodynamic limit, we derive a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation.

The Monte Carlo method is based on a probabilistic representation of the radiative transfer equations involving an augmented scalar transport equation where the polarization parameters are independent variables. The linear moments of the augmented transport equation with respect to the polarization parameters solve the matrix-valued radiative transfer equations. We show how polarization and depolarization effects develop in time for isotropic and unpolarized point sources, considered for concreteness in spherical and half-space geometries.

abstract={Semiconductor superlattices are a very interesting example of a nonlinear dynamical system with a large number of degrees of freedom. They show a strongly nonlinear behavior and they are well suited for the observation of current instabilities. In the present work, the dynamical behavior of undoped photoexcited superlattices has been analyzed by numerical continuation methods and bifurcation theory within the framework of a simple drift-diffusion model. The control parameters are the applied dc voltage and the carrier density, which are related to the laser power. We compile our results in a phase diagram and locate the lines where the system undergoes qualitative changes of behavior. The oscillatory regions are related to the appearance and disappearance of Hopf tongue crossings, for which oscillations appear as sub- or supercritical bifurcations. This implies the existence of voltage windows of current oscillations and hysteresis in appropriate parameter ranges, which agrees with recent experimental observations.},

We consider biological tissues that can be modeled as continuous media varying randomly in space, containing inhomogeneities, with no sharp boundaries.},

abstract={Radiative transfer theory provides a good framework for the study of multiple scattering in the randomly inhomogeneous lithosphere. Envelopes of high-frequency seismograms (mainly S coda waves) of local earthquakes have been synthesized on the basis of this theory, and inversions for some Earth parameters such as intrinsic attenuation, scattering attenuation and degree of non-isotropic scattering have been carried out. However, a scalar model has often been assumed because of its mathematical relative simplicity. The simplification amounts to neglecting the polarized nature of the underlying motion. This approach is only valid for long lapse times when S waves become unpolarized because of high-order scattering, and cannot be justified by only assuming that the source is unpolarized. We show that incoming unpolarized S waves can be up to 80 per cent polarized after single scattering. Depolarization of S waves after multiple scattering is studied by a Monte Carlo method. We show that the scattering of S waves off different kinds of inhomogeneities gives rise to different polarization and depolarization patterns. Consequently, polarization should provide valuable information for the understanding of the physics of wave motion and the properties of the Earth's lithosphere.},

abstract={Numerical evidence as well as an analytical description is given for the existence of a kind of "uncertainty principle" in the mean-field model (of the Kuramoto type) of large populations of nonlinearly coupled oscillators. Here the noise plays the role of the Planck constant. This means that there is a limit to the possibility of synchronizing both, phases and frequencies. The collective phase synchronization competes in fact, within such a model, with the frequency synchronization. The explanation rests on the effect of the noise, which is responsible for loss of accuracy. Comparison is made with a more sophisticated model, where such uncertainty is absent when the coupling parameter is sufficiently large. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We present a complete description of the stationary and dynamical behavior of semiconductor superlattices in the framework of a discrete drift model by means of numerical continuation, singular perturbation analysis, and bifurcation techniques. The control parameters are the applied DC voltage (φ) and the doping (ν) in nondimensional units. We show that the organizing centers for the long time dynamics are Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation points in a broad range of parameters and we cast our results in a φ-ν phase diagram. For small values of the doping, the system has only one uniform solution where all the variables are almost equal. For high doping we find multistability corresponding to domain solutions and the stationary solutions may exhibit chaotic spatial behavior. In the intermediate regime of ν the solution can be time-periodic depending on the bias. The oscillatory regions are related to the appearance and disappearance of Hopf bifurcation tongues which can be sub- or supercritical. These results are in good agreement with most of the experimental observations and also predict new interesting dynamical behavior.},

A simple gyrofluid model is used which evolves in time equations for the ion density or vorticity, the parallel ion velocity, and the ion temperature where Landau damping is included through a linear closure relation. Adiabatic electrons and the electrostatic approximation are assumed to hold. Linear calculations indicate that the growth rates are significantly reduced in the presence of Landau damping. Nonlinear single helicity calculations serve to illustrate the spatial localization of the turbulence in the presence of Landau damping. Finally nonlinear multiple helicity calculations performed with three different values for the ratio of the central ion Larmor radius to the plasma minor radius denoted by ρ* exhibit a definite linear scaling of all the fluctuation characteristics, such as levels, scale sizes, quasilinear profile modifications, self-generated poloidal flows, and heat diffusivities, with ρ*. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={A test particle description of the runaway dynamics is used to analyze some of the main mechanisms limiting the runaway energy in a tokamak plasma. It is found that the synchrotron radiation losses associated with the electron gyromotion around the magnetic field lines can explain the energy limit of runaway electrons found experimentally by observing their bremsstrahlung spectra during the current ramp-up of low density Ohmic discharges in the Joint European Torus (JET) [Nucl. Fusion 25, 1011 (1985)]. The model is applied to the problem of determining the influence of a resonance between the electron gyromotion and the magnetic field ripple of the tokamak on the radiation loss and energy limits of runaway electrons. The equilibrium energy at the resonance and the conditions under which the ripple mechanism can create an upper bound on the runaway energy are investigated. Predictions are discussed on the effect of the ripple resonance on the maximum energy attainable by disruption generated runaway electrons in JET and the projected International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [ITER EDA Agreement and Protocol 2, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1994]. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The current oscillations in semiconductor superlattices under domain formation, which are due to a recycling of the domain boundary, contain additional spikes of much higher frequency than the fundamental oscillations. While the recycling of the domain boundary covers a larger number of periods of the superlattice, these spikes are due to a relocation of the domain boundary, which is a charge monopole, by one period. The number of spikes within one period of the fundamental oscillation can therefore serve as a measure for the number of periods, which are involved in the recycling motion. The theoretical model used in the simulations of the dynamics of the domain boundary has been outlined in Ref. [2]. In addition we have included a time delay in the drift term (proportional to the tunneling probability through a given barrier) so that the drift term is evaluated at a previous time, (t-τtun). This accounts for the nonzero tunneling time τtun that is estimated as the scattering time due to the interaction between electrons and Coulombic impurities, interface defects and optical and acoustical phonons. Delay effects occur when the average time that the monopole spends crossing a SL period (roughly, the oscillation period divided by number of wells) is comparable to the tunneling time. Our simulations show that the time delay results in high-frequency spikes similar to those experimentally observe. In the following figure we show the time evolution of the current, (a), and the electric-field profiles at the times depicted in the inset, (b).},

abstract={Ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence, also referred as ηi-mode, has been proposed as one of the dominant mechanisms determining the transport properties in the core of magnetic fusion devices such as tokamaks. In this work we intend to study the saturated ITG turbulence using a non-linear fluid description of the plasma including time evolution equations for perturbed ion density, parallel velocity and temperature in cylindrical-toroidal geometry. This problem has been treated numerically developing a parallel code to run in a Masivelly Parallel Machine with distributed memory, like CRAY-T3E. Finite differences in radius and Fourier mode expansion in poloidal and toroidal angles have been used. The numerical scheme is time implicit for linear terms and time explicit for nonlinear term. These nonlinear terms are quadratic nonlinearities that become convolutions of the Fourier components. The implicit linear term is solved with inversion of block tridiagonal matrices. To numerically advance these equations, a two-step, second-order accurate, time-centered advancement scheme is used. The serial code runs on all processors in a synchronous way, each processor works over a part of the problem. The distribution of calculations is: in harmonic Fourier to solve the implicit part (mainly invert matrices), and in radial points for the explicit calculations (mainly convolutions). In each time step, all processors must know the results obtained with the rest. To make this, the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) routines have been used to send and receive the data between processors.},

abstract={We present and numerically solve a model of the photorefractive Gunn effect. We find that high-field domains can be triggered by phase-locked interference fringes, as has been recently predicted on the basis of linear stability considerations. Since the Gunn effect is intrinsically nonlinear, we find that such considerations give at best order-of-magnitude estimations of the parameters critical to the photorefractive Gunn effect. The response of the system is much more complex, including multiple wave shedding from the injecting contact, wave suppression, and chaos with spatial structure. © 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={A two-timescale asymptotic method has been introduced to analyze the multimodal mean-field Kuramoto model of oscillator synchronization in the high-frequency limit. The method allows to uncouple the probability density in different components corresponding to the different peaks of the oscillator frequency distribution. Each component evolves towards a stationary state in a comoving frame and the overall order parameter can be reconstructed by combining them. Synchronized phases are a combination of traveling waves and incoherent solutions depending on parameter values. Our results agree very well with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density. Numerical results have been obtained by finite differences and a spectral method in the particular case of bimodal (symmetric and asymmetric) frequency distribution with or without external field. We also recover in a very easy and intuitive way the only other known analytical results: those corresponding to reflection-symmetric bimodal frequency distributions near bifurcation points.

In addition, the trajectories of the test electrons in momentum space show a stable equilibrium point that sets a limit on the energy that the runaway electrons can reach.

abstract={Full cross section calculations of ion-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence with Landau closure are being carried out as part of the Numerical Tokamak Turbulence Project, one of the U. S. Department of Energy's Phase II Grand Challenges. To include the full cross section of a magnetic fusion device like the tokamak requires more memory and CPU time than is available on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center's (NERSC's) shared-memory vector machines such as the CRAY C90 and J90. Calculations of cylindrical multihelicity ion-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence were completed on NERSC's 160-processor distributed-memory CRAY T3E parallel computer with 256 Mbytes of memory per processor. This augurs well for yet more memory and CPU intensive calculations on the next-generation T3E at NERSC. This paper presents results on benchmarks with the current T3E at NERSC. Physics results pertaining to plasma confinement at the core of tokamaks subject to ion-temperature- gradient-driven-turbulence are also highlighted. Results at this resolution covering this extent of physical time were previously unattainable. Work is in progress to increase the resolution, improve the performance of the parallel code, and include toroidal geometry in these calculations in anticipation of the imminent arrival of a fully configured, 512-processor, T3E-900 model. © 1997 ACM.},

abstract={In doped, weakly coupled superlattices, current self-oscillations occur due to a recycling motion of a charge monopole, which forms the boundary between two electric field domains. In addition to these fundamental oscillations, the current also contains a high-frequency modulation in form of spikes, which are caused by the tunneling process of the charge monopole over a single superlattice period. The number of spikes within one fundamental oscillation can therefore serve as a measure for the number of superlattice periods, which are involved in the recycling motion. Spiking may reflect non-stationary tunneling effects for sufficiently large applied electric fields.},

Each stage may be described by one evolution equation for only one degree of freedom (the current density), except for the generation of each new wave.

The model is well suited to test the idea that an entropy collapse is at the bottom line of the dynamical singularity encountered in structural glasses. The model is studied in three dimensions through Monte Carlo simulations, which put in evidence fragile glass behavior with stretched exponential relaxation and super-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation time. Our data are in favor of a Vogel-Fulcher behavior of the relaxation time, related to an entropy collapse at the Kauzmann temperature. We, however, encounter difficulties analogous to those found in experimental systems when extrapolating thermodynamical data at low temperatures. We study the spin-glass susceptibility, investigating the behavior of the correlation length in the system. We find that the increase of the relaxation time is accompanied by a very slow growth of the correlation length. We discuss the scaling properties of off-equilibrium dynamics in the glassy regime, finding qualitative agreement with the mean-field theory. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={This paper presents a cost‐effectiveness analysis of explicit Finite Difference (FD) methods for the numerical integration of the wave equation. Formal notions of computational cost (expressed in floating point operations) and numerical dispersion error are introduced. Restricting the analysis to leapfrog timemarching, for sake of simplicity, various spatial discrete differentiators are examined. For each scheme, by minimizing the cost at a given error threshold, a cost‐effective operating poin (time sampling rate and number of gridpoints per shortest wavelength) is obtained, which is remarkably different from the stability limit. Different schemes, each operated at its cost‐effective point, are then compared. High‐order dispersion‐bounded operators, in the sense of Holberg,1 are found to be competitive with the Pseudo‐spectral (PS) method. New optimal schemes improving over the Holberg's spatial differentiators are introduced together with accurate expansions of the convolutional weights is terms of the design error threshold. It is also shown that the composition of two distinct Holberg's operators of consecutive orders, with opposite phase properties, minimizes dispersion and yields cost‐effective schemes. Numerical experiments illustrate the suitability of the new methods for large‐scale wave‐equation seismic modelling. Copyright © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Self-sustained current oscillations have been found in doped GaAs-AlAs superlattices and are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The electric-field distribution in doped superlattices becomes unstable if the carrier density is not sufficiently large to form stable domains. The instability results in self-oscillations of the current, which are due to an oscillatory motion of the domain boundary in the superlattice. A discrete drift model taking into account several regions of negative differential velocity and a large electron density clearly establishes the origin of these oscillations. © 1995 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.},

abstract={Self-sustained oscillations of the current have been observed and simulated in a doped GaAs-AlAs superlattice under voltage control. Depending on the applied bias the detected frequencies vary betwen 250 kHz at low voltages and 20 MHz at high voltages. Amplitude and frequency decrease with increasing carrier density until, at very high excitation densities, stable electric-field domains are formed. A discrete drift model reproduces the current oscillations and shows that they can be attributed to the spatial oscillation of the boundary between the two domains. © 1995 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The computational aspects of the finite-element method for the elastic wave equations are considered. The necessary numerical techniques are analysed from the point of view of accuracy, performance and storage requirements when implemented in scalar and vector processors with large storage capacity. The method is implemented on an IBM 3090 with vector facility. We consider five different time integration schemes (explicit and implicit central difference, Houbolt, constant average acceleration and Wilson), and in the implicit case, both direct (Gaussian decomposition) and iterative (successive over-relaxation, Jacobi semi-iterative, Jacobi conjugate gradient) sparse linear system solvers. These solvers are taken from the ITPACK-2C and ESSL libraries using in each case the adequate representation scheme; skyline, row-wise and compressed diagonal. It is concluded that constant average acceleration and explicit central difference are the most adequate integration methods and Jacobi conjugate gradient is the most efficient solver.},

abstract={Known procedures for designing numerical schemes for the integration of elastodynamic equations with explicit control over numerical dispersion are reviewed. In the literature, the analysis of such schemes has concentrated on the discrete space differentiators, and has neglected the role played by time discretization in the overall accuracy. In this paper we define a computational cost for a given dispersion error bound which fully includes the effect of temporal differencing. For some representative schemes based on leap-frog time marching, we provide an optimal operating point (time sampling rate and number of grid points per shortest wavelength) which minimizes the computational cost for a given dispersion error threshold. Based on this notion of cost, we introduce new optimal operators for staggered grids. Additionally, we introduce the notion of composite differentiators to design still more cost-effective schemes. The cost of the proposed schemes is shown to be less than that of known finite difference (FD) operators and compares favorably with pseudo-spectral (PS) algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new operators. © 1990.},

abstract={Finite-difference (FD) schemes for the numerical integration of the wave equation are generally designed with one of two criteria: (a) maximize the numerical accuracy order (as In the case of conventional FD operators); (b) minimize the simulation error of some physical feature of wave propagation (e.g. the dispersion relation) within a spectral frequency band (as introduced recently by Holberg). The analysis of cost-effectiveness for a required error bound of the second schemes has neglected the role played by time discretization in the overall accuracy. In this paper we define a computational cost for the numerical solution of wave equations, which includes the effect of approximate temporal differencing. For some representative schemes based on leap-frog time differencing we provide an optimal operating point (time sampling rate and number of grid points per shortest wavelength) which minimizes the computational cost for a given error threshold. We also introduce a new method for designing optimal operators for staggered schemes. The new FD operators are designed and their optimal operating point is found by minimizing the computational cost for a prescribed error bound. The cost of the proposed schemes is shown to be less than that of known FD operators and compares favorably with pseudo-spectral (PS) operators.

abstract={For the correct interpretation of data gathered in the seismic prospecting of complex heterogeneous structures, elastic effects must often be taken into consideration. The use of the elastic wave equations to model the seismic response of an hypothesized geological structure is a valuable tool for relating observed seismic data to the earth's inhomogeneities and verify an interpretation. Several methods may be used to integrate numerically the partial differential equations describing elastic wave propagation. Pseudospectral (Fourier) methods represent the leading numerical integration technique. Their main advantage is high accuracy and suitability to vector and parallel computer architectures, while their main drawback is high computational cost. However, for a given accuracy, the required grid size with pseudospectral methods is smaller than that required by finite‐difference schemes, thus balancing the computational cost. We describe a two‐dimensional pseudospectral elastic model implemented on the vector multiprocessor IBM 3090 VF. The algorithm has been suitably adapted to fully exploit the computer architecture and thereby maximize the performance. The elastic model has been validated in a variety of problems in geophysics and, in particular, in the amplitude‐versus‐offset analysis which has proved to be an effective technique to extract additional information from the recorded (prestack) data. With proper conditioning and processing of seismic data, and separating amplitude variations due to changes in reflectivity from variations due to other effects, the resulting offset signatures have been successfully used, for instance, to distinguish true bright spots due to gas‐bearing sands, from false ones associated with lithological changes. To interpret the observed amplitude‐versus‐offset signatures, it is necessary to know the reflection coefficients as a function of angle and frequency for planar interfaces, as well as for other structures of geological interest. The modelling is first validated by computing the reflection coefficients for planar interfaces, and then used to analyse the reflection signatures of thin beds, corrugated interfaces and multilayers. Their implications, as well as impact on amplitude‐versus‐offset analysis, are discussed. We conclude that elastic modelling is an effective and valuable tool to further our understanding of the amplitude anomalies observed in field data. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract={The Stacking Velocity Analysis of seismic reflection data is based on the approximation of the traveltime curves in Common-Depth-Point (CDP) gathers with hyperbolic trajectories. The analysis is customarily performed in the "physical" offset-time framework and produces a timevelocity histogram, the Velocity Spectrum. The accuracy of the velocity estimates depends on the adequacy of the CDP model to the earth's structure, the quality of the data, and the resolving power of the estimation method chosen. In this last regard a very important role is played by the optimality criterion, i.e., the functional to be maximized. This paper introduces a new class of complex-valued coherency functionals operating on complex-valued traces, designed to emphasize phase correlation and to reduce the estimate uncertainty. The algorithms are evaluated on test cases using synthetic and field data. In particular, it is shown that higher resolutions can be obtained postprocessing the complex coherency spectra with a suitable phase-enhancement technique. © 1996-2018 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.
