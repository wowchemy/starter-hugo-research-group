abstract: In this paper we consider narrow band, active array imaging of weak localized
  scatterers when only the intensities are recorded at an array with N transducers.
  We assume that the medium is homogeneous and, hence, wave propagation is fully coherent.
  This work is an extension of our previous paper [A. Novikov, M. Moscoso, and G.
  Papanicolaou, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 8 (2015), pp. 1547-1573], where we showed that
  using linear combinations of intensity-only measurements, obtained from N2 illuminations,
  imaging of localized scatterers can be carried out efficiently using imaging methods
  based on the singular value decomposition of the time-reversal matrix. Here we show
  that the same strategy can be accomplished with only 3N - 2 illuminations, therefore
  enormously reducing the data acquisition process. Furthermore, we show that in the
  paraxial regime one can form the images by using six illuminations only. In particular,
  this paraxial regime includes Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. The key point
  of this work is that if one controls the illuminations, imaging with intensity only
  can be easily reduced to an imaging with phases and, therefore, one can apply standard
  imaging techniques. Detailed numerical simulations illustrate the performance of
  the proposed imaging strategy with and without data noise. © 2016 Society for Industrial
