abstract: Radial basis function-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) based on the
  combination of polyharmonic splines (PHS) with high degree polynomials have recently
  emerged as a powerful and robust numerical approach for the local interpolation
  and derivative approximation of functions over scattered node layouts. Among the
  key features, (i) high orders of accuracy can be achieved without the need of selecting
  a shape parameter or the issues related to numerical ill-conditioning, and (ii)
  the harmful edge effects associated to the use of high order polynomials (better
  known as Runge's phenomenon) can be overcome by simply increasing the stencil size
  for a fixed polynomial degree. The present study complements our previous results,
  providing an analytical insight into RBF-FD approximations augmented with polynomials.
  It is based on a closed-form expression for the interpolant, which reveals the mechanisms
  underlying these features, including the role of polynomials and RBFs in the interpolant,
  the approximation error, and the behavior of the cardinal functions near boundaries.
  Numerical examples are included for illustration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
