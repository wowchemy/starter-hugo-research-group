abstract: In this work we study the limits for the applicability condition and a method
  to improve the structural reconstruction algorithm for breast lesions detection
  and characterization reported in [1]. The strategy shown in this reference permits
  to detect and characterize the tumors of 1 cm diameter situated deeply inside the
  dense breast if the contrast between dielectric permittivity of tumor and surrounding
  tissue is at least 1.5. However, in some cases [2], experimentally, it has been
  reported that the contrast can be lower. Therefore, we consider cases in which low
  contrast leads to more difficult reconstructions. Our study of limitations of algorithm
  shows that by mean of additional regularization by using prior average values of
  dielectric parameters in human breast, even in case of contrast 1.2, the detection
  of 1 cm tumors is robust. Our contribution is to show that statistical criteria
  during the tumor search in cases when the average dielectric properties are not
  available, leads to localization of tumor and its separation from reconstruction
  'ghosts'. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.
