abstract: It is well known that overdamped unforced dynamical systems do not oscillate.
  However, well-designed coupling schemes, together with the appropriate choice of
  initial conditions, can induce oscillations when a control parameter exceeds a threshold
  value. In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. E, 68, 045102(R) (2003)], we demonstrated
  this behavior in a specific prototype system, a soft-potential mean-field description
  of the dynamics in a hysteretic “single-domain” ferromagnetic sample. The previous
  analysis of this work showed that [Formula presented] (odd) unidirectionally coupled
  elements with cyclic boundary conditions would, in fact, oscillate when a control
  parameter—in this case the coupling strength—exceeded a critical value. These oscillations
  are now finding utility in the detection of very weak “target” signals, via their
  effect on the oscillation characteristics, e.g., the frequency and asymmetry of
  the oscillation wave forms. In this paper we explore the underlying dynamics of
  this system. Scaling laws that govern the oscillation frequency in the vicinity
  of the critical point, as well as the zero-crossing intervals in the presence of
  a symmetry-breaking target dc signal, are derived; these quantities are germane
  to signal detection and analysis. © 2004 The American Physical Society.
