abstract: Recent endocardial mapping systems reconstruct an instantaneous image of
  the endocardial electrical activity performing the inverse problem of electrocardiography
  (IPE), which consists ofestimating the endocardial surface potentials from intracavitary
  probe potentials. Even though the IPE has been long studied, it still being paid
  attention due to its ill-posed nature, and many different regularization techniques
  have been explored in this setting. In this study we analyzed Support Vector machines
  (SVM) as an alternative regularization technique regarding their robustness against
  ill-posed problems. We propose here two new SVM algorithms, specifically adapted
  to the ill-posing issues ofthe IPE, and develop the equations for endocar- dial
  mapping oftransmembrane currents. We show, both in simple simulations and in a previously
  developed cellular automata, that the ill-posing robustness ofthe SVM is higher
  when compared to regularized approaches during the depolarization phase. In conclusion,
  the properties ofthe developed SVM algorithms stand for an appropriate framework
  for addressing the IPE.
