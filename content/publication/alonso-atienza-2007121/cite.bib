 abstract = {Recent endocardial mapping systems reconstruct an instantaneous image of the endocardial electrical activity performing the inverse problem of electrocardiography (IPE), which consists ofestimating the endocardial surface potentials from intracavitary probe potentials. Even though the IPE has been long studied, it still being paid attention due to its ill-posed nature, and many different regularization techniques have been explored in this setting. In this study we analyzed Support Vector machines (SVM) as an alternative regularization technique regarding their robustness against ill-posed problems. We propose here two new SVM algorithms, specifically adapted to the ill-posing issues ofthe IPE, and develop the equations for endocar- dial mapping oftransmembrane currents. We show, both in simple simulations and in a previously developed cellular automata, that the ill-posing robustness ofthe SVM is higher when compared to regularized approaches during the depolarization phase. In conclusion, the properties ofthe developed SVM algorithms stand for an appropriate framework for addressing the IPE.},
