abstract: A comparison is made between the probabilistic domain decomposition (DD)
  method and a certain deterministic DD method for solving linear elliptic boundary-value
  problems. Since in the deterministic approach the CPU time is affected by intercommunications
  among the processors, it turns out that the probabilistic method performs better,
  especially when the number of subdomains (hence, of processors) is increased. This
  fact is clearly illustrated by some examples. The probabilistic DD algorithm has
  been implemented in an MPI environment, in order to exploit distributed computer
  architectures. Scalability and fault-tolerance of the probabilistic DD algorithm
  are emphasized. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
