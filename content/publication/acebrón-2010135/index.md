abstract: Initial- and initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear one-dimensional
  parabolic partial differential equations are solved numerically by a probabilistic
  domain decomposition method. This is based on a probabilistic representation of
  solutions by means of branching stochastic processes. Only few values of the solution
  inside the space-time domain are generated by a Monte Carlo method, and an interpolation
  is then made so to approximate suitable interfacial values of the solution inside
  the domain. In this way, a fully decoupled set of sub-problems is obtained. This
  method allows for an efficient massively parallel implementation, is scalable and
  fault tolerant. Numerical examples, including some for the KPP equation and beyond
  are given to show the performance of the algorithm. © 2010 Springer Science+Business
