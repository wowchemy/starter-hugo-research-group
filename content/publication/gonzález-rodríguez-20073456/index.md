abstract: We solve direct and inverse obstacle-scattering problems in a half-space
  composed of a uniform absorbing and scattering medium. Scattering is sharply forward-peaked,
  so we use the modified Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative transport equation.
  The obstacle is an absorbing inhomogeneity that is thin with respect to depth. Using
  the first Born approximation, we derive a method to recover the depth and shape
  of the absorbing obstacle. This method requires only plane-wave illumination at
  two incidence angles and a detector with a fixed numerical aperture. First we recover
  the depth of the obstacle through solution of a simple non-linear least-squares
  problem. Using that depth, we compute a point-spread function explicitly. We use
  that point-spread function in a standard deconvolution algorithm to reconstruct
  the shape of the obstacle. Numerical results show the utility of this method even
  in the presence of measurement noise. © 2007 Optical Society of America.
