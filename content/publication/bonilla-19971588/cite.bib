 abstract = {The continuum limit of a recently proposed model for charge transport in resonant-tunneling semiconductor superlattices (SLs) is analyzed. It is described by a nonlinear hyperbolic integrodifferential equation on a one-dimensional spatial support, supplemented by shock and entropy conditions. For appropriate parameter values, a time-periodic solution is found in numerical simulations of the model. An asymptotic theory shows that the time-periodic solution is due to recycling and motion of shock waves representing domain walls connecting regions of the SL where the electric field is almost uniform.},
