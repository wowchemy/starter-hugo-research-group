abstract: In this work we explore the applicability of the RBF method to laminar flame
  propagation modeling. This problem is an interesting challenge for the RBF method
  since it involves the solution of two coupled nonlinear parabolic equations in temperature
  and mass fraction. We show the suitability of the method by solving unsteady flame
  propagation problems in one and two dimensions. We also apply the method to compute
  the shape of an anchored flame using both equispaced and non-equispaced nodes. ©
