abstract: We propose a method for imaging in scattering media when large and diverse
  datasets are available. It has two steps. Using a dictionary learning algorithm
  the first step estimates the true Green’s function vectors as columns in an unordered
  sensing matrix. The array data comes from many sparse sets of sources whose location
  and strength are not known to us. In the second step, the columns of the estimated
  sensing matrix are ordered for imaging using the multidimensional scaling algorithm
  with connectivity information derived from cross-correlations of its columns, as
  in time reversal. For these two steps to work together, we need data from large
  arrays of receivers so the columns of the sensing matrix are incoherent for the
  first step, as well as from sub-arrays so that they are coherent enough to obtain
  connectivity needed in the second step. Through simulation experiments, we show
  that the proposed method is able to provide images in complex media whose resolution
  is that of a homogeneous medium. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.
