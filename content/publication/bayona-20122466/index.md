abstract: In this follow up paper to our previous study in Bayona et al. (2011) [2],
  we present a new technique to compute the solution of PDEs with the multiquadric
  based RBF finite difference method (RBF-FD) using an optimal node dependent variable
  value of the shape parameter. This optimal value is chosen so that, to leading order,
  the local approximation error of the RBF-FD formulas is zero. In our previous paper
  (Bayona et al., 2011) [2] we considered the case of an optimal (constant) value
  of the shape parameter for all the nodes. Our new results show that, if one allows
  the shape parameter to be different at each grid point of the domain, one may obtain
  very significant accuracy improvements with a simple and inexpensive numerical technique.
  We analyze the same examples studied in Bayona et al. (2011) [2], both with structured
  and unstructured grids, and compare our new results with those obtained previously.
  We also find that, if there are a significant number of nodes for which no optimal
  value of the shape parameter exists, then the improvement in accuracy deteriorates
  significantly. In those cases, we use generalized multiquadrics as RBFs and choose
  the exponent of the multiquadric at each node to assure the existence of an optimal
  variable shape parameter. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
