abstract: This work designs a methodology to quantify the uncertainty of a volatility
  parameter in a stochastic control problem arising in energy management. The difficulty
  lies in the non-linearity of the underlying scalar Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
  We proceed by decomposing the unknown solution on a Hermite polynomial basis (of
  the unknown volatility), whose different coefficients are solutions to a system
  of second order parabolic non-linear PDEs. Numerical tests show that computing the
  first basis elements may be enough to get an accurate approximation with respect
  to the uncertain volatility parameter. We provide an example of the methodology
  in the context of a swing contract (energy contract with flexibility in purchasing
  energy power), this allows us to introduce the concept of Uncertainty Value Adjustment
  (UVA), whose aim is to value the risk of misspecification of the volatility model.
