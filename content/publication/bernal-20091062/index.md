abstract: The performance of Kansa's method in the solution of elliptic partial differential
  equations (PDEs) with singular boundary conditions is addressed. Like in all global
  numerical schemes, low-order singularities bring about Gibbs' oscillations that
  deteriorate the accuracy and the convergence rate of Kansa's method to a great extent.
  Moreover, they may render it uncapable of handling common problems of incompressible
  flow. Focussing on a problem of Laplacian flow which is linked to the benchmark
  Motz problem, it is shown how all these difficulties can be overcome by enriching
  the radial basis function (RBF) interpolant with the proper singularity-capturing
  terms. This simple modification even enables Kansa's method to outperform the finite
  element method (FEM) in the conservation of Laplacian flow through an irregular
  channel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
