abstract: A spectral method is developed to numerically solve the so-called Kuramoto-Sakaguchi
  equation, which is a nonlinear integro-differential equation of the parabolic type,
  governing the dynamical statistical behaviour of certain populations of nonlinearly
  coupled random oscillators. The approach rests on explicit bounds for the space
  derivatives of solutions, obtained via energy-like estimates. Bounds for the numerical
  approximations of solutions are given, and improved (sometimes appreciably) by means
  of an 'a posteriori error analysis'. Plots are shown to illustrate the performance
  of the method, and comparison with a finite difference approach is also made.
