abstract: The existence of a bistable behavior between (partially) synchronized stationary
  states, occurring in large populations of nonlinearly coupled random oscillators,
  was studied. This was done in the framework of the so-called Kuramot model. A central
  peak in the natural frequency distribution allowed for the existence of bistability
  between stationary solutions.
