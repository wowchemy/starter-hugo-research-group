abstract: In the numerical results of [1], the reported signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
  are incorrect. We give the correct SNR values below. • For the results shown in
  figure 2 and corresponding discussion, SNR = 45.334 dB. • For the results shown
  in figure 7 and corresponding discussion, SNR = 55.146 dB. • For the results shown
  in figure 9 and corresponding discussion, SNR = 45.387 dB. • For the results shown
  in figure 10 and corresponding discussion, SNR = 105.172 dB. • For the results shown
  in figure 11 and corresponding discussion, SNR = 105.172 dB for figure 11(b), SNR
  = 55.247 dB for figure 11(c), and SNR = 25.211 dB for figure 11(d). Data availability
