abstract: Numerical evidence as well as an analytical description is given for the
  existence of a kind of \"uncertainty principle\" in the mean-field model (of the
  Kuramoto type) of large populations of nonlinearly coupled oscillators. Here the
  noise plays the role of the Planck constant. This means that there is a limit to
  the possibility of synchronizing both, phases and frequencies. The collective phase
  synchronization competes in fact, within such a model, with the frequency synchronization.
  The explanation rests on the effect of the noise, which is responsible for loss
  of accuracy. Comparison is made with a more sophisticated model, where such uncertainty
  is absent when the coupling parameter is sufficiently large. © 2000 Elsevier Science
