abstract: We present an iterative scheme, reminiscent of the Multigrid method, to
  solve large boundary value problems with Probabilistic Domain Decomposition (PDD).
  In it, increasingly accurate approximations to the solution are used as control
  variates in order to reduce the Monte Carlo error of the following iterates—resulting
  in an overall acceleration of PDD for a given error tolerance. The key feature of
  the proposed algorithm is the ability to approximately predict the speedup with
  little computational overhead and in parallel. Besides, the theoretical framework
  allows to explore other aspects of PDD, such as stability. One numerical example
  is worked out, yielding an improvement between one and two orders of magnitude over
  the previous version of PDD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd
