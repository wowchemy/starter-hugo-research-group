 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the potential and limitations of cross-correlation techniques using numerical simulations, and in particular, we intend to show (i) an estimate of the Green's function in different configurations and (ii) results for passive imaging. This problem seems especially interesting in seismology, nondestructive testing, structure health monitoring, and wireless sensor networks. To compute cross correlations of the impulse signals collected by the receivers, we consider scattering by discrete scatterers to generate impluse responses with targets and without targets. We compute the difference of the cross correlations with targets and the cross correlations without targets to estimate the backpropagator (Green's function) in the Kirchhoff migration functional. The migration functional is essential to compute images of targets. We run numerical simulations for different configurations to explore the limitations of this cross correlation methodology from the results of passive imaging. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},
