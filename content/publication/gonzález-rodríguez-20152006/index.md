abstract: We present a computational study of diffuse optical tomography using the
  one-way radiative transfer equation. The one-way radiative transfer is a simplification
  of the radiative transfer equation to approximate the transmission of light through
  tissues. The major simplification of this approximation is that the intensity satisfies
  an initial value problem rather than a boundary value problem. Consequently, the
  inverse problem to reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients from transmission
  measurements of scattered light is simplified. Using the initial value problem for
  the one-way radiative transfer equation to compute the forward model, we are able
  to quantitatively reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients efficiently
  and effectively for simple problems and obtain reasonable results for complicated
  problems. © 2015 Optical Society of America.
