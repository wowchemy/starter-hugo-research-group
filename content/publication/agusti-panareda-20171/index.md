abstract: 'It is a widely established fact that standard semi-Lagrangian advection
  schemes are highly efficient numerical techniques for simulating the transport of
  atmospheric tracers. However, as they are not formally mass conserving, it is essential
  to use some method for restoring mass conservation in long time range forecasts.
  A common approach is to use global mass fixers. This is the case of the semi-Lagrangian
  advection scheme in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model used by the Copernicus
  Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts (ECMWF). Mass fixers are algorithms with substantial differences in complexity
  and sophistication but in general of low computational cost. This paper shows the
  positive impact mass fixers have on the inter-hemispheric gradient of total atmospheric
  column-averaged CO2 and CH4, a crucial feature of their spatial distribution. Two
  algorithms are compared: the simple \"proportional\" and the more complex Bermejo-Conde
  schemes. The former is widely used by several Earth system climate models as well
  the CAMS global forecasts and analysis of atmospheric composition, while the latter
  has been recently implemented in IFS. Comparisons against total column observations
  demonstrate that the proportional mass fixer is shown to be suitable for the low-resolution
  simulations, but for the high-resolution simulations the Bermejo-Conde scheme clearly
  gives better results. These results have potential repercussions for climate Earth
  system models using proportional mass fixers as their resolution increases. It also
  emphasises the importance of benchmarking the tracer mass fixers with the inter-hemispheric
  gradient of long-lived greenhouse gases using observations. © Author(s) 2017.'
