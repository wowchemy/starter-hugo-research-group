abstract: We present a complete description of the stationary and dynamical behavior
  of semiconductor superlattices in the framework of a discrete drift model by means
  of numerical continuation, singular perturbation analysis, and bifurcation techniques.
  The control parameters are the applied DC voltage (φ) and the doping (ν) in nondimensional
  units. We show that the organizing centers for the long time dynamics are Takens-Bogdanov
  bifurcation points in a broad range of parameters and we cast our results in a φ-ν
  phase diagram. For small values of the doping, the system has only one uniform solution
  where all the variables are almost equal. For high doping we find multistability
  corresponding to domain solutions and the stationary solutions may exhibit chaotic
  spatial behavior. In the intermediate regime of ν the solution can be time-periodic
  depending on the bias. The oscillatory regions are related to the appearance and
  disappearance of Hopf bifurcation tongues which can be sub- or supercritical. These
  results are in good agreement with most of the experimental observations and also
  predict new interesting dynamical behavior.
