abstract: We introduce a new approach for narrow band array imaging of localized scatterers
  from intensity-only measurements by considering the possibility of reconstructing
  the positions and reflectivities of the scatterers exactly from only partial knowledge
  of the array data, since we assume that phase information is not available. We reformulate
  this intensity-only imaging problem as a non-convex optimization problem and show
  that we can have exact recovery by minimizing the rank of a positive semidefinite
  matrix associated with the unknown reflectivities. Since this optimization problem
  is NP-hard and is computationally intractable, we replace the rank of the matrix
  by its nuclear norm, the sum of its singular values, which is a convex programming
  problem that can be solved in polynomial time. Numerical experiments explore the
  robustness of this approach, which recovers sparse reflectivity vectors exactly
  as solutions of a convex optimization problem. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.
