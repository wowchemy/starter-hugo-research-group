abstract: A probabilistic representation for initial value semilinear parabolic problems
  based on generalized random trees has been derived. Two different strategies have
  been proposed, both requiring generating suitable random trees combined with a Pade
  approximant for approximating accurately a given divergent series. Such series are
  obtained by summing the partial contribution to the solution coming from trees with
  arbitrary number of branches. The new representation greatly expands the class of
  problems amenable to be solved probabilistically, and was used successfully to develop
  a generalized probabilistic domain decomposition method. Such a method has been
  shown to be suited for massively parallel computers, enjoying full scalability and
  fault tolerance. Finally, a few numerical examples are given to illustrate the remarkable
  performance of the algorithm, comparing the results with those obtained with a classical
  method. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
