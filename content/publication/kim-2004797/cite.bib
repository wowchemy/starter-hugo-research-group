 abstract = {We calculate the radiance of a light beam propagating in a uniformly scattering and absorbing slab and determine the point-spread function. We do this by solving numerically the governing radiative transport equation by use of plane-wave mode expansions. When scattering is sharply peaked in the forward direction and it becomes difficult to solve the radiative transport equation, we replace it with either the Fokker-Planck or the Leakeas-Larsen equation. We also solve these equations by using plane-wave mode expansions. Numerical results show that these two equations agree with the radiative transport equation for large anisotropy factors. The agreement improves as the optical thickness increases. © 2004 Optical Society of America.},
