abstract: We present a study of the polarization effects resulting from the reflection
  and transmission of a narrow beam of light through biological tissues. This is done
  numerically with a Monte Carlo method based on a transport equation which takes
  into account polarization of light. We will show both time-independent and time-dependent
  computations, and we will discuss how polarization can be used in order to obtain
  better images. We consider biological tissues that can be modeled as continuous
  media varying randomly in space, containing inhomogeneities, with no sharp boundaries.
