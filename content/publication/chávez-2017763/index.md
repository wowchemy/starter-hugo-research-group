abstract: In this paper, we analyze the use of simple models for solving the inverse
  problem in electrocardiography (IPE), which aims at recovering the heart condition
  from a set of remote voltages measurements. Specifically, we consider here the problem
  of estimating the shape, size and location of cardiac ischemic regions. The forward
  problem to generate the data (voltage measurements) is formulated by using the Luo-Rudy
  model, which provides a detailed description of the electrical behavior of cardiac
  cells. As for the inversion process, we use the two-current phenomenological model.
  The inversion procedure also incorporates a semi-automatic stage to characterize
  the conduction properties of the cardiac tissue. The ischemic regions are modeled
  by using standard level set techniques. Numerical results show that the algorithm
  is capable of estimating the position, size and shape of cardiac ischemic regions
  from noisy voltage measurements, for both 2D and 3D geometries. Our inverse procedure
  is benchmarked against zero-order Tikhonov regularization. This work is a proof
  of principle demonstrating the possibility of using simple models in the IPE towards
  realistic situations. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.
