abstract: The paper describes a new RBF-FD based technique to compute quadrature weights
  on the sphere. In the proposed method, the sphere is divided into rectangles in
  the latitude-azimuth coordinate system, and the function is integrated over each
  rectangle using RBF interpolation. The method is easy to implement and its accuracy
  is comparable to that based on SPH expansions. One advantage of the proposed method
  is its ability to handle non-uniform node distributions. On this respect, we propose
  a new algorithm to cluster nodes in regions of steep changes in the function. It
  is a repulsion-based algorithm with a non-uniform distribution of electrical charges.
  We show that, using node clustering, the accuracy of the method can be significantly
  improved. © 2022 M. Kindelan et al.
