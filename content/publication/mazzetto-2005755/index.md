abstract: An approach based on the fractional Fourier transform is proposed for both
  analysis and synthesis of fiber Bragg gratings. The method is shown to be simple
  and accurate. A comparison is made with the results of the numerical integration
  of the full Riccati equation, which are valid for arbitrary reflectivities. The
  method being very efficient, processing times can be short enough for a real-time
  control of the writing process, during grating manufacturing. The effects of profile
  random irregularities on FBG performance are studied, and several examples, useful
  for design purposes, are given. © Springer 2005.
