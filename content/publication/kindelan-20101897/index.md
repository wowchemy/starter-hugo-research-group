abstract: In this paper, we introduce a radial basis function collocation method for
  computing solutions to the time-dependent radiative transfer equation. For these
  computations, we use finite differences to discretize the time coordinate, a discrete
  ordinate method to discretize the directional variable, and an expansion in radial
  basis functions to approximate the spatial dependence of the solution. The main
  advantages of the RBF method are that it does not require any mesh or grid, achieves
  spectral accuracy in multi-dimensions for arbitrary node layouts, and it is extremely
  simple to implement. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
