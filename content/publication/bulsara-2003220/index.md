abstract: We examine the response of a 2D nonlinear oscillator (exemplified in this
  work by the two-junction superconducting quantum interference device - SQUID) subject
  to a weak time-periodic target signal, just past the onset of a saddle-node bifurcation.
  Adjusting the control parameters of the device allows us to identify a regime wherein
  the response (characterized by an output signal-to-noise ratio at the target frequency)
  is maximal. The phenomenon has the flavor of the well-studied stochastic resonance
  effect but is, in fact, shown to arise from a nonlinear deterministic resonance
  in the \"running solution\" regime. Our results are presented in the context of
  experimental results. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
