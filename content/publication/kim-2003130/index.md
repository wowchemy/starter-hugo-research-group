abstract: To examine the phenomenon of polarization memory, we examine time resolved
  backscattering of circularly polarized plane waves normally incident on a slab containing
  a random distribution of latex spheres in water. For large spheres polarization
  memory occurs a short time after first order scattering and before depolarization.
  It is the result of successive near forward scattering events that maintain the
  incident wave's helicity. For moderately large scatterers, it exhibits a simple
  dependence on the anisotropy factor. For larger spheres or those with higher refractive
  indices, it also depends on complicated angular and polarization characteristics
  of backscattering given by Mie theory.
