abstract: In this work we derive analytical expressions for the weights of Gaussian
  RBF-FD formulas for some differential operators. These weights are used to derive
  analytical expressions for the leading order approximations to the local truncation
  error in powers of the internode distance h and the shape parameter ε. We show that
  for each differential operator, there is a range of values of the shape parameter
  for which RBF-FD formulas are significantly more accurate than the corresponding
  standard FD formulas. In fact, very often there is an optimal value of the shape
  parameter ε+ for which the local error is zero to leading order. This value can
  be easily computed from the analytical expressions for the leading order approximations
  to the local error. Contrary to what is generally believed, this value is, to leading
  order, independent of the internodal distance and only dependent on the value of
  the function and its derivatives at the node. © 201 WIT Press.
