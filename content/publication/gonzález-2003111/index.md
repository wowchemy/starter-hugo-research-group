abstract: Curing of epoxy resins with aliphatic diamines at low temperatures deviates
  from the 4EQ mechanism (catalytic and non-catalytic dual path) at relatively low
  conversions, far from vitrification. Although the Horie mechanism relies on a third
  order reaction it is possible a more realistic approach to epoxy curing kinetics
  if a detailed analysis of auto-acceleration is made. A single parameter dependent
  only on the nature of the amine is proposed.
