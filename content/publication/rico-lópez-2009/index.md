abstract: 'The practical experience of parallelising a simulator of gen- eral scattering
  and radiation electromagnetic problems is presented. The simulator stems from an
  existing sequential simulator in the frequency domain and can be fruitfully used
  in applications such as the test of coverage of a wireless net- work, analysis of
  complex structures, and so on. After the analysis of a test case, two steps were
  carried out: firstly, a \"hand-crafted\" code parallelisation was developed within
  the kernel of the simulator. Secondly, the sequential library, used in the existing
  simulator, was replaced by the parallel MUMPS library in order to solve the associated
  linear al- gebra problem in parallel. For factorising the matrix with MUMPS, two
  different ordering methods have been consid- ered. Copyright © 2009 ICST.'
