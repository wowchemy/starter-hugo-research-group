abstract: The problem of reconstructing images from measurements at the boundary of
  a domain belong to the class of inverse problems. In practice, these measurements
  are incomplete and inaccurate leading to ill-posed problems. This means that 'exact'
  reconstructions are usually not possible. In this Introduction the reader will find
  some applications in which the main ideas about stability and resolution in image
  reconstruction are discussed. We will see that although different applications or
  imaging modalities work under different physical principles and map different physical
  parameters, they all share the same mathematical foundations and the tools used
  to create the images have a great deal in common. Current imaging problems deal
  with understanding the trade off between data size, the quality of the image and
  the computational tools used to create the image. In many cases, these tools represent
  the performance bottleneck due to the high operational count and the memory cost.
