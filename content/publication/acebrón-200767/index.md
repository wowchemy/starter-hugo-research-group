abstract: 'Present and future supercomputers offer many opportunities and advantages
  to attack complex and demanding industrial and applied mathematical problems, but
  provide also new challenges. In the Peta-Flops regime, these concern both, the way
  to exploit the increasingly available power and the need of designing algorithms
  which are scalable and fault-tolerant at the same time. An example of a probabilistic
  domain decomposition method, which is indeed scalable and naturally fault-tolerant,
  is presented. Grid computing should also be mentioned as an increasingly popular
  way to perform massively distributed computing: it represents a way to exploit computing
  power, aside the existing supercomputers. Beyond classical supercomputers there
  is the prospective quantum computer, in view of which it is advisable to start now
  a search for suitable algorithms for certain classes of problems. © Springer Science+Business
