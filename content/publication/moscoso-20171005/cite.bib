 abstract = {We propose an illumination strategy for interferometric imaging that allows for robust depth recovery from intensity-only measurements. For an array with colocated sources and receivers, we show that all the possible interferometric data for multiple sources, receivers, and frequencies can be recovered from intensity-only measurements provided that we have sufficient source location and frequency illumination diversity. There is no need for phase reconstruction in this approach. Using interferometric imaging methods we show that in homogeneous media there is no loss of resolution when imaging with intensities only. If in these imaging methods we reduce incoherence by restricting the multifrequency interferometric data to nearby array elements and nearby frequencies we obtain robust images in weakly inhomogeneous background media with a somewhat reduced resolution. © 2017 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},
