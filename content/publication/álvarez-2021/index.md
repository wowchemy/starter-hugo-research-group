abstract: We introduce a new local meshfree method for the approximation of the Laplace–Beltrami
  operator on a smooth surface in R3. It is a direct method that uses radial basis
  functions augmented with multivariate polynomials. A key element of this method
  is that it does not need an explicit expression of the surface, which can be simply
  defined by a set of scattered nodes. Likewise, it does not require expressions for
  the surface normal vectors or for the curvature of the surface, which are approximated
  using explicit formulas derived in the paper. An additional advantage is that it
  is a local method and, hence, the matrix that approximates the Laplace–Beltrami
  operator is sparse, which translates into good scalability properties. The convergence,
  accuracy and other computational characteristics of the proposed method are studied
  numerically. Its performance is shown by solving two reaction–diffusion partial
  differential equations on surfaces; the Turing model for pattern formation, and
  the Schaeffer’s model for electrical cardiac tissue behavior. © 2021, The Author(s),
