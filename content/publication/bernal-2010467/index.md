abstract: In this paper, numerical and implementation aspects of the phase-field crystal
  model with elastic interactions are addressed. This model leads to a time-dependent,
  sixth-order system of differential equations which yields a continuous density field,
  from which individual atom positions can be extracted and tracked in time. We solve
  the system using high-order finite elements, and reconstruct the elastic properties
  of the crystal from the atomic displacements with a meshless interpolation scheme.
  Numerical simulations are performed of benchmark experiments, which include deformation
  and dislocation dynamics. © 2010 Carl Hanser Verlag.
