 abstract = {The paper describes an investigation that was conducted to develop a mathematical model based solely on primary boundary conditions and including the heat storage capacity of the soil. The soil is modelled by a two-dimensional heat conduction equation and the temperature at a certain depth is specified as boundary condition.},
