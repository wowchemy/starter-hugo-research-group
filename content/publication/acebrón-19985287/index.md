abstract: The mean-field Kuramoto model for synchronization of phase oscillators with
  an asymmetric bimodal frequency distribution is analyzed. Breaking the reflection
  symmetry facilitates oscillator synchronization to rotating wave phases. Numerical
  simulations support the results based on bifurcation theory and high-frequency calculations.
  In the latter case, the order parameter is a linear superposition of parameters
  corresponding to rotating and counterrotating phases.© 1998 The American Physical
  Society.
