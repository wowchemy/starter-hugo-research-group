abstract: The influence of relative refractive index on the depolarization of multiply
  scattered waves was investigated. Circularly and linearly polarized continuous waves
  incident on a medium with spherical scatterers showed dependence of circular depolarization
  length on refractive index. Circular depolarization systematically decreased after
  each scattering. Linear depolarization decreased with randomization of directions
  and was approximately equal to the transport mean free path.
