abstract: A discrete drift model of sequential resonant tunneling in weakly-coupled
  doped or undoped GaAs/AlAs superlattices (SL) under d.c. or d.c. + a.c. voltage
  bias and laser illumination is analyzed. In agreement with experiments our model
  shows an oscillatory I-V diagram for large enough values of the doping and/or laser
  illumination, multistability and hysteresis between stationary solutions and self-sustained
  time dependent oscillations of the current. Numerical and asymptotic analyses of
  the model show that these current oscillations are due to the formation, motion,
  annihilation and regeneration of negatively charged domain walls on the SL. For
  appropriate d.c. + a.c. voltage bias, chaotic current oscillations with loss of
  spatial coherence of the electric field will appear due to random nucleation of
  domains in the SL.
