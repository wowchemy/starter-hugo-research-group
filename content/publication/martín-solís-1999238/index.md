abstract: A test particle description of the runaway dynamics is used to analyze some
  of the main mechanisms limiting the runaway energy in a tokamak plasma. It is found
  that the synchrotron radiation losses associated with the electron gyromotion around
  the magnetic field lines can explain the energy limit of runaway electrons found
  experimentally by observing their bremsstrahlung spectra during the current ramp-up
  of low density Ohmic discharges in the Joint European Torus (JET) [Nucl. Fusion
  25, 1011 (1985)]. The model is applied to the problem of determining the influence
  of a resonance between the electron gyromotion and the magnetic field ripple of
  the tokamak on the radiation loss and energy limits of runaway electrons. The equilibrium
  energy at the resonance and the conditions under which the ripple mechanism can
  create an upper bound on the runaway energy are investigated. Predictions are discussed
  on the effect of the ripple resonance on the maximum energy attainable by disruption
  generated runaway electrons in JET and the projected International Thermonuclear
  Experimental Reactor (ITER) [ITER EDA Agreement and Protocol 2, International Atomic
  Energy Agency, Vienna, 1994]. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.
