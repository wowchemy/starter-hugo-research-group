abstract: The numerical solution of large-scale PDEs, such as those occurring in data-driven
  applications, unavoidably require powerful parallel computers and tailored parallel
  algorithms to make the best possible use of them. In fact, considerations about
  the parallelization and scalability of realistic problems are often critical enough
  to warrant acknowledgement in the modelling phase. The purpose of this paper is
  to spread awareness of the Probabilistic Domain Decomposition (PDD) method, a fresh
  approach to the parallelization of PDEs with excellent scalability properties. The
  idea exploits the stochastic representation of the PDE and its approximation via
  Monte Carlo in combination with deterministic high-performance PDE solvers. We describe
  the ingredients of PDD and its applicability in the scope of data science. In particular,
  we highlight recent advances in stochastic representations for non-linear PDEs using
  branching diffusions, which have significantly broadened the scope of PDD. We envision
  this work as a dictionary giving large-scale PDE practitioners references on the
  very latest algorithms and techniques of a non-standard, yet highly parallelizable,
  methodology at the interface of deterministic and probabilistic numerical methods.
  We close this work with an invitation to the fully non-linear case and open research
  questions. © Cambridge University Press 2017.
