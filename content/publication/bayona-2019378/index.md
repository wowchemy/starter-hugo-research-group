abstract: Radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) approximations
  generalize grid-based regular finite differences to scattered node sets. These become
  particularly effective when they are based on polyharmonic splines (PHS) augmented
  with multi-variate polynomials (PHS+poly). One key feature is that high orders of
  accuracy can be achieved without having to choose an optimal shape parameter and
  without having to deal with issues related to numerical ill-conditioning. The strengths
  of this approach were previously shown to be especially striking for approximations
  near domain boundaries, where the stencils become highly one-sided. Due to the polynomial
  Runge phenomenon, regular FD approximations of high accuracy will in such cases
  have very large weights well into the domain. The inclusion of PHS-type RBFs in
  the process of generating weights makes it possible to avoid this adverse effect.
  With that as motivation, this study aims at gaining a better understanding of the
  behavior of PHS+poly generated RBF-FD approximations near boundaries, illustrating
  it in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
