abstract: We study active array imaging of small but strong scatterers in homogeneous
  media when multiple scattering between them is important. We use the Foldy-Lax equations
  to model wave propagation with multiple scattering when the scatterers are small
  relative to the wavelength. In active array imaging we seek to locate the positions
  and reflectivities of the scatterers, that is, to determine the support of the reflectivity
  vector and the values of its nonzero elements from echoes recorded on the array.
  This is a nonlinear inverse problem because of the multiple scattering. In this
  paper, we show how to avoid the nonlinearity and form images noniteratively through
  a two-step process which involves l norm minimization. However, under certain illuminations
  imaging may be affected by screening, where some scatterers are obscured by multiple
  scattering. This problem can be mitigated by using multiple and diverse illuminations.
  In this case, we determine solution vectors that have a common support. The uniqueness
  and stability of the support of the reflectivity vector obtained with single or
  multiple illuminations are analyzed, showing that the errors are proportional to
  the amount of noise in the data with a proportionality factor dependent on the sparsity
  of the solution and the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix, which is determined
  by the geometry of the imaging array. Finally, to filter out noise and improve the
  resolution of the images, we propose an approach that combines optimal illuminations
  using the singular value decomposition of the response matrix together with sparsity
  promoting optimization jointly for all illuminations. In this work, an extension
  of our previous paper [A. Chai, M. Moscoso, and G. Papanicolaou, Inverse Problems,
  29 (2013), 025016] on imaging using optimization techniques, we now account for
  multiple scattering effects. © 2014 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
