 abstract = {We have determined the capture and emission coefficients by EL2 traps in semi-insulating n-GaAs using available experimental results. To this end, we have derived a simplified mathematical model from the complete drift-diffusion equations by singular perturbation methods. The capture and emission coefficients are adjusted so that the numerically obtained steady-state and high-field charge dipole solutions of the simplified model match the available experimental results. © 1999 American institute of Physics.},
