abstract: We present a method to obtain quantitatively accurate images of small obstacles
  or inhomogeneities situated near the surface of a strongly scattering medium. The
  method uses time-resolved measurements of backscattered light to form the images.
  Using the asymptotic solution of the radiative transfer equation for this problem,
  we determine that the key information content in measurements is modeled by a diffusion
  approximation that is valid for small sourcedetector distances, and shallow penetration
  depths. We simplify this model further by linearizing the effect of the inhomogeneities
  about the known background optical properties using the Born approximation. The
  resulting model is used in a two-stage imaging algorithm. First, the spatial location
  of the inhomogeneities are determined using a modification of the multiple signal
  classification (MUSIC) method. Using those results, we then determine the quantitative
  values of the inhomogeneities through a least-squares approximation. We find that
  this two-stage method is most effective for reconstructing a sequence of one-dimensional
  images along the penetration depth corresponding to null source-detector separations
  rather than simultaneously using measurements over several source-detector distances.
  This method is limited to penetration depths and distances between boundary measurements
  on the order of the scattering mean-free path. © 2018 Optical Society of America
