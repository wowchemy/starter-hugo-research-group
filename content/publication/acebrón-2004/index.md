abstract: The effect of noise in the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, a noisy dynamical
  system, was investigated. A Fokker-Planck equation was also derived for both a network
  of globally coupled elements and single element. The resonance behavior for a noisy
  two-dimwnsional SQUID, that followed a different dynamics than the FHN model, was
  also analyzed. It was found that the FHN system underwent a Hopf bifurcation, and
  the natural frequencies remaned the same with the decreasing number of the coupled
  elements.
