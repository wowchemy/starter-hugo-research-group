abstract: 'We present a holographic imaging approach for the case in which a single
  source-detector pair is used to scan a sample. The source-detector pair collects
  intensity-only data at different frequencies and positions. By using an appropriate
  illumination strategy, we recover field cross correlations over different frequencies
  for each scan location. The problem is that these field cross correlations are asynchronized,
  so they have to be aligned first in order to image coherently. This is the main
  result of the paper: a simple algorithm to synchronize field cross correlations
  at different locations. Thus, one can recover full field data up to a global phase
  that is common to all scan locations. The recovered data are, then, coherent over
  space and frequency so they can be used to form high-resolution three-dimensional
  images. Imaging with intensity-only data is therefore as good as coherent imaging
  with full data. In addition, we use an `1-norm minimization algorithm that promotes
  the low dimensional structure of the images, allowing for deep high-resolution imaging.
