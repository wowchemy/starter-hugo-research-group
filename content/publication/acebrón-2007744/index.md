abstract: In this paper, we describe a new kind of domain decomposition strategy for
  solving linear elliptic boundary-value problems. It outperforms the traditional
  ones in complex and heterogeneous networks like those for grid computing. Such a
  strategy consists of a hybrid numerical scheme based on a probabilistic method along
  with a domain decomposition, and full decoupling can be accomplished. While the
  deterministic approach is strongly affected by intercommunication among the hosts,
  the probabilistic method is scalable as the number of subdomains, i.e., the number
  of processors involved, increases. This fact is clearly illustrated by an example,
  even operating in a grid environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
