abstract: Phase models describing self-synchronization phenomena in populations of
  globally coupled oscillators are generalized including “inertial” effects. This
  entails that the oscillator frequencies also vary in time along with their phases.
  The model can be described by a large set of Langevin equations when noise effects
  are also included. Also, a description of such systems can be given in the thermodynamic
  limit of infinitely many oscillators via a suitable Fokker-Planck-type equation.
  Numerical simulations confirm that simultaneous synchronization of phases and frequencies
  is possible when the coupling strength goes to infinity. © 1998 The American Physical
