abstract: Radiative transfer theory provides a good framework for the study of multiple
  scattering in the randomly inhomogeneous lithosphere. Envelopes of high-frequency
  seismograms (mainly S coda waves) of local earthquakes have been synthesized on
  the basis of this theory, and inversions for some Earth parameters such as intrinsic
  attenuation, scattering attenuation and degree of non-isotropic scattering have
  been carried out. However, a scalar model has often been assumed because of its
  mathematical relative simplicity. The simplification amounts to neglecting the polarized
  nature of the underlying motion. This approach is only valid for long lapse times
  when S waves become unpolarized because of high-order scattering, and cannot be
  justified by only assuming that the source is unpolarized. We show that incoming
  unpolarized S waves can be up to 80 per cent polarized after single scattering.
  Depolarization of S waves after multiple scattering is studied by a Monte Carlo
  method. We show that the scattering of S waves off different kinds of inhomogeneities
  gives rise to different polarization and depolarization patterns. Consequently,
  polarization should provide valuable information for the understanding of the physics
  of wave motion and the properties of the Earth's lithosphere.
