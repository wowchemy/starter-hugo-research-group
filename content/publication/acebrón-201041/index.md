abstract: A new parallel numerical algorithm based on generating suitable random trees
  has been developed for solving nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations.
  This algorithm is suited for current high performance supercomputers, showing a
  remarkable performance and arbitrary scalability. While classical techniques based
  on a deterministic domain decomposition exhibits strong limitations when increasing
  the size of the problem (mainly due to the intercommunication overhead), probabilistic
  methods allow us to exploit massively parallel architectures since the problem can
  be fully decoupled. Some examples have been run on a high performance computer,
  being scalability and performance carefully analyzed. Large-scale simulations confirmed
  that computational time decreases proportionally to the cube of the number of processors,
  whereas memory reduces quadratically. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
