abstract: A Monte Carlo algorithm is derived to solve the one-dimensional telegraph
  equations in a bounded domain subject to resistive and non-resistive boundary conditions.
  The proposed numerical scheme is more efficient than the classical Kac's theory
  because it does not require the discretization of time. The algorithm has been validated
  by comparing the results obtained with theory and the Finite-difference time domain
  (FDTD) method for a typical two-wire transmission line terminated at both ends with
  general boundary conditions. We have also tested transmission line heterogeneities
  to account for wave propagation in multiple media. The algorithm is inherently parallel,
  since it is based on Monte Carlo simulations, and does not suffer from the numerical
  dispersion and dissipation issues that arise in finite difference-based numerical
  schemes on a lossy medium. This allowed us to develop an efficient numerical method,
  capable of outperforming the classical FDTD method for large scale problems and
  high frequency signals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..
