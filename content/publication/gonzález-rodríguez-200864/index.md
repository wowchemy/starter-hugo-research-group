abstract: We study light propagation in a half-space composed of two homogeneous layers
  each having different optical properties from the other. This problem is a model
  for light propagation in tissues composed of a thin epithelial layer supported from
  below by a thick stromal layer. The interface between the two layers is irregular.
  Assuming that this interface is a small perturbation of a plane that is parallel
  to the boundary surface, we obtain an asymptotic approximation to the solution.
  We give a numerical method to compute this asymptotic approximation. Finally, we
  show how to recover this irregular interface surface from boundary measurements
  when the optical properties of the two layers are known. © 2007 Optical Society
