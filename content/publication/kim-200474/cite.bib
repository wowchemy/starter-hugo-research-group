 abstract = {For a beam impinging on a scattering medium the diffusion approximation to the radiative transport equation is not valid for analyzing the radiance near the source, especially if the medium scatters strongly with a sharp forward peak. To analyze the radiance, we use the Fokker–Planck approximation to the radiative transport equation. Numerical results show a backscattered ring appearing around the beam center. It also appears in Monte Carlo simulations of the radiative transport equation. This ring is manifested from successive near-forward scattering events, so it requires a directional description. Therefore the diffusion approximation cannot predict this ring. © 2004 Optical Society of America.},
