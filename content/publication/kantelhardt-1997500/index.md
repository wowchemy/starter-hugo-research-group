abstract: In doped, weakly coupled superlattices, current self-oscillations occur
  due to a recycling motion of a charge monopole, which forms the boundary between
  two electric field domains. In addition to these fundamental oscillations, the current
  also contains a high-frequency modulation in form of spikes, which are caused by
  the tunneling process of the charge monopole over a single superlattice period.
  The number of spikes within one fundamental oscillation can therefore serve as a
  measure for the number of superlattice periods, which are involved in the recycling
  motion. Spiking may reflect non-stationary tunneling effects for sufficiently large
  applied electric fields.
