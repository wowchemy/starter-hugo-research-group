abstract: We consider the matrix-valued radiative transfer equations for the Stokes
  parameters for the propagation of light through turbulent atmospheres. A Monte Carlo
  method is introduced to solve the time dependent matrix-valued radiative transfer
  equations in 3D geometry. The Monte Carlo method is based on a probabilistic representation
  of the radiative transfer equations involving an augmented scalar transport equation
  where the polarization parameters are independent variables. The linear moments
  of the augmented transport equation with respect to the polarization parameters
  solve the matrix-valued radiative transfer equations. We show how polarization and
  depolarization effects develop in time for isotropic and unpolarized point sources,
  considered for concreteness in spherical and half-space geometries. We analyze in
  detail the creation of polarization by single- and multiple-scattering effects.
