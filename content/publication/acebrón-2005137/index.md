abstract: Synchronization phenomena in large populations of interacting elements are
  the subject of intense research efforts in physical, biological, chemical, and social
  systems. A successful approach to the problem of synchronization consists of modeling
  each member of the population as a phase oscillator. In this review, synchronization
  is analyzed in one of the most representative models of coupled phase oscillators,
  the Kuramoto model. A rigorous mathematical treatment, specific numerical methods,
  and many variations and extensions of the original model that have appeared in the
  last few years are presented. Relevant applications of the model in different contexts
  are also included. © 2005 The American Physical Society.
