abstract: Monte Carlo as well as quasi-Monte Carlo methods are used to generate only
  few interfacial values in two-dimensional domains where boundary-value elliptic
  problems are formulated. This allows for a domain decomposition of the domain. A
  continuous approximation of the solution is obtained interpolating on such interfaces,
  and then used as boundary data to split the original problem into fully decoupled
  subproblems. The numerical treatment can then be continued, implementing any deterministic
  algorithm on each subdomain. Both, Monte Carlo (or quasi-Monte Carlo) simulations
  and the domain decomposition strategy allow for exploiting parallel architectures.
  Scalability and natural fault tolerance are peculiarities of the present algorithm.
  Examples concern Helmholtz and Poisson equations, whose probabilistic treatment
  presents additional complications with respect to the case of homogeneous elliptic
  problems without any potential term and source. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights
