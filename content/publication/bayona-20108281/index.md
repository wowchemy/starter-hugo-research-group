abstract: The local RBF is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to the
  global version that suffers from ill-conditioning. In this paper, we study analytically
  the convergence behavior of the local RBF method as a function of the number of
  nodes employed in the scheme, the nodal distance, and the shape parameter. We derive
  exact formulas for the first and second derivatives in one dimension, and for the
  Laplacian in two dimensions. Using these formulas we compute Taylor expansions for
  the error. From this analysis, we find that there is an optimal value of the shape
  parameter for which the error is minimum. This optimal parameter is independent
  of the nodal distance. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical experiments.
